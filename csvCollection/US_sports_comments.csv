@AimanHossain-j5s,2,"anyways heres how to make beef wellington 

Step 1
Using kitchen twine, tie tenderloin in 4 places. Season generously with salt and pepper.
Step 2
Over high heat, coat bottom of a heavy skillet with olive oil. Once pan is nearly smoking, sear tenderloin until well-browned on all sides, including the ends, about 2 minutes per side (12 minutes total). Transfer to a plate. When cool enough to handle, snip off twine and coat all sides with mustard. Let cool in fridge.
Step 3
Meanwhile, make duxelles: In a food processor, pulse mushrooms, shallots, and thyme until finely chopped.
Step 4
To skillet, add butter and melt over medium heat. Add mushroom mixture and season with salt and pepper. Cook until liquid has evaporated and mixture is sticking to the bottom of the pan, about 10 minutes. Transfer to a bowl and let cool in fridge. Step 5
Place plastic wrap down on a work surface, overlapping so that it’s twice the length and width of the tenderloin. Arrange the prosciutto on the plastic wrap into a rectangle that’s big enough to cover the whole tenderloin. Spread the duxelles evenly and thinly over the prosciutto.
Step 6
Place tenderloin at the bottom of the prosciutto. Roll meat into prosciutto-mushroom mixture, using plastic wrap to roll tightly. Tuck ends of prosciutto as you roll, then twist ends of plastic wrap tightly into a log and transfer to fridge to chill (this helps it maintain its shape).
Step 7
Heat oven to 425°. Lightly flour your work surface, then spread out puff pastry and roll it into a rectangle that will cover the tenderloin (just a little bigger than the prosciutto rectangle you just made!). Remove tenderloin from plastic wrap and place on bottom of puff pastry. Brush the other three edges of the pastry with egg wash, then tightly roll beef into pastry. Step 8
Once the log is fully covered in puff pastry, trim any extra pastry, then crimp edges with a fork to seal well. Wrap roll in plastic wrap to get a really tight cylinder, then chill for 20 minutes.
Step 9
Remove plastic wrap, then transfer roll to a foil-lined baking sheet. Brush with egg wash and score lightly with a sharp knife. Sprinkle with flaky salt.
Step 10
Bake until pastry is golden and the center registers 120°F for medium-rare, about 40 to 45 minutes. Let rest 20 minutes before carving and serving",eo3vmt7R2Vw

@Football-prods1.0,1,"The F-22 Raptor is combination of stealth, supercruise, maneuverability, and integrated avionics, coupled with improved supportability, represents an exponential leap in warfighting capabilities. The Raptor performs both air-to-air and air-to-ground missions allowing full realization of operational concepts vital to the 21st century Air Force.  The F-22, a critical component of the Global Strike Task Force, is designed to project air dominance, rapidly and at great distances and defeat threats attempting to deny access to our nation's Air Force, Army, Navy and Marine Corps. The F-22 cannot be matched by any known or projected fighter aircraft.  Features A combination of sensor capability, integrated avionics, situational awareness, and weapons provides first-kill opportunity against threats. The F-22 possesses a sophisticated sensor suite allowing the pilot to track, identify, shoot and kill air-to-air threats before being detected. Significant advances in cockpit design and sensor fusion improve the pilot's situational awareness. In the air-to-air configuration the Raptor carries six AIM-120 AMRAAMs and two AIM-9 Sidewinders. The F-22 has a significant capability to attack surface targets. In the air-to-ground configuration the aircraft can carry two 1,000-pound GBU-32 Joint Direct Attack Munitions internally and will use on-board avionics for navigation and weapons delivery support. In the future air-to-ground capability will be enhanced with the addition of an upgraded radar and up to eight small diameter bombs. The Raptor will also carry two AIM-120s and two AIM-9s in the air-to-ground configuration.  Advances in low-observable technologies provide significantly improved survivability and lethality against air-to-air and surface-to-air threats. The F-22 brings stealth into the day, enabling it not only to protect itself but other assets.  The F-22 engines produce more thrust than any current fighter engine. The combination of sleek aerodynamic design and increased thrust allows the F-22 to cruise at supersonic airspeeds (greater than 1.5 Mach) without using afterburner -- a characteristic known as supercruise. Supercruise greatly expands the F-22 's operating envelope in both speed and range over current fighters, which must use fuel-consuming afterburner to operate at supersonic speeds.  The sophisticated F-22 aerodesign, advanced flight controls, thrust vectoring, and high thrust-to-weight ratio provide the capability to outmaneuver all current and projected aircraft. The F-22 design has been extensively tested and refined aerodynamically during the development process.  The F-22's characteristics provide a synergistic effect ensuring F-22A lethality against all advanced air threats. The combination of stealth, integrated avionics and supercruise drastically shrinks surface-to-air missile engagement envelopes and minimizes enemy capabilities to track and engage the F-22. The combination of reduced observability and supercruise accentuates the advantage of surprise in a tactical environment.  The F-22 will have better reliability and maintainability than any fighter aircraft in history.  Increased F-22 reliability and maintainability pays off in less manpower required to fix the aircraft and the ability to operate more efficiently.  Background The Advanced Tactical Fighter entered the Demonstration and Validation phase in 1986. The prototype aircraft (YF-22 and YF-23) both completed their first flights in late 1990. Ultimately the YF-22 was selected as best of the two and the engineering and manufacturing development effort began in 1991 with development contracts to Lockheed/Boeing (airframe) and Pratt & Whitney (engines). EMD included extensive subsystem and system testing as well as flight testing with nine aircraft at Edwards Air Force Base, Calif. The first EMD flight was in 1997 and at the completion of its flight test life this aircraft was used for live-fire testing.  The program received approval to enter low rate initial production in 2001. Initial operational and test evaluation by the Air Force Operational Test and Evaluation Center was successfully completed in 2004. Based on maturity of design and other factors the program received approval for full rate production in 2005. Air Education and Training Command, Air Combat Command and Pacific Air Forces are the primary Air Force organizations flying the F-22.  The aircraft designation was the F/A-22 for a short time before being renamed F-22A in December 2005.  General characteristics Primary function: air dominance, multi-role fighter Contractor: Lockheed-Martin, Boeing Power plant: two Pratt & Whitney F119-PW-100 turbofan engines with afterburners and two-dimensional thrust vectoring nozzles. Thrust: 35,000-pound class (each engine) Wingspan: 44 feet, 6 inches (13.6 meters) Length: 62 feet, 1 inch (18.9 meters) Height: 16 feet, 8 inches (5.1 meters) Weight: 43,340 pounds (19,700 kilograms)   Maximum takeoff weight: 83,500 pounds (38,000 kilograms)   Fuel capacity: internal: 18,000 pounds (8,200 kilograms); with 2 external wing fuel tanks: 26,000 pounds (11,900 kilograms) Payload: same as armament air-to-air or air-to-ground loadouts; with or without two external wing fuel tanks. Speed:  mach two class with supercruise capability Range: more than 1,850 miles ferry range with two external wing fuel tanks (1,600 nautical miles) Ceiling: above 50,000 feet (15 kilometers) Armament: one M61A2 20-millimeter cannon with 480 rounds, internal side weapon bays carriage of two AIM-9 infrared (heat seeking) air-to-air missiles and internal main weapon bays carriage of six AIM-120 radar-guided air-to-air missiles (air-to-air loadout) or two 1,000-pound GBU-32 JDAMs and two AIM-120 radar-guided air-to-air missiles (air-to-ground loadout) Crew: one Unit cost: $143 million Initial operating capability:  December 2005 Inventory: total force, 183",c6g4DgPbKu8

@iamthem.a.n.middleagednerd1053,76,"In 1996 I was 13 and I wrote a letter to the Chicago Bulls, c.o. Michael Jordan. It was about 4 or 5 pages if I remember correctly. I wish I ciuld remember everything I wrote, but I did lavish praise on how well Rodman seemed to fit into the team and how amazing it was that he played so well that year after having a year and a half layoff from playing baseball. 
   Within a couple of weeks I got a letter back. It wasn't written by Michael but they sent me a few nice things including a glossy 8""x10"" that was signed by MJ. I took it to a coin and memorabilia shop back in 2001 and they said it was an authenticate signature. They offered me $70 at the time. I declined.
