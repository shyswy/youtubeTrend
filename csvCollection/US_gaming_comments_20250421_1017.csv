@stainlessstove4629,4,At 0:46 Oscar didnt leave max any space. Max ended up ahead of Oscar in the corner before being puished off. Anyone else think that the 5 second penalty was too harsh? Verstappen should have won.,Li93iQDZQeg

@havokblades9440,65,Man this is hard  I do love Bueno but I don’t understand the pick up. Why are we dropping people who are underperforming and signing someone who just got dropped from a worse team…for underperforming? Just doesn’t make sense to me,PKLo0sJT4o8

@Crow5537,4,Somehow I’ve never wanted an optic season to end sooner then this one,PKLo0sJT4o8
@eduarebelo20,3,This is literally what makes the difference  just the mentality of that faze team. The S&D and HP on vault were Optic’s games to lose. Faze did what they had to do which was trying to keep playing consistently and hope for the mistakes  which is what great teams in any sport do when they are on the back foot. And optic  although playing better  did them the favor of throwing both games.,PKLo0sJT4o8

@TannerSidetrax,11,Mumbo  just wanted to say I have been a long time viewer of yours (likely over ten years now) and it made me super happy to see you in the movie and had a good chuckle seeing what the costume department did to you.  I went to see the movie opening weekend with my girlfriend and her two kids (6 and 8) and we just had the best time. There wasn't a frown in theatre  and both of the kids were so excited to see the movie and super pleased afterwards. It was a really great memory we were able to create as her kids and I are really able to connect over our mutual love of Minecraft. Thank you to you  Jared Hess and everyone else who really made something everyone can enjoy. The production team couldn't have asked for a better redstone consultant. You deserved this.,GTAGFUy25J4

Minimal graphics and they were known enough,p5BZgfQ2yJI
@mattheopichetti9258,0,Two things we can learn from this. 1) Good games arent made with more money or more people.   2) The west is completely lost culturally and morally. Under grips of a drug epidemic  people chose to play drug distribution games.,p5BZgfQ2yJI

@vandarik5766,0,one thing about WoW in this regard is that it was actually cool when we had professions that had quests built around them and better items were gated behind them so it would feel like you were going on this epic quest to be the best Smith or whatever but Blizzard alway drops the ball in professions and doesn't go all out like they should and open that up and build the world adventuring and interaction around it. World quests were kind of a let down classic wow quests for professions were cool and so was some of the stuff they did in WoD and Legion. What would be even better is having professions craftables be different based on class and have unique properties that make them good for their class almost replacing artifact or systems or whatever like warrior paladins and death knights could craft different gear only available to their individual class that provided unique properties only to them but make this the same idea for every single profession that way the content is immersive but also allow them to craft other items that allow the players to make reasonable in game currency and have real value in ingame content and I feel in shadowlands legendary items had some elements of this idea but they should really take it further minus the grueling downsides of farming for those blasted legendary's. Now I'm not saying you shouldn't farm but I think complex recipes that make you adventure the game and clear content to acquire materials is the ideal way to do things and ultimately make it hard for bots to farm the most valuable resources reducing their power in the in game economy. They have to do something about the zombie accounts even if it means rigging the game against them. I hope the government shuts down the wow token so blizzard has to actually take responsibility for all the hackers that made it necessary in the first place and honestly the in game economy is ruined for the new casual player  you have to buy wow tokens in retail now  you have to and that is messed up why would anyone want to come play this game with the expectation they will have to dump large sums of money in order to have any real success or enjoyment? What are these developers and publishers thinking?,p5BZgfQ2yJI

@chocolatyonderer4278,53,Hi mark  you may not read this but I just want to let you know that since I was in college  stuck in my dorm  doing my thesis in the dead of the night  your videos have accompanied me a lot to fill in the silence  panics  and anxieties I had. I thought I wouldn't make it  but I did..  Years later  I am in my Master's program  doing my thesis once again  in my room  at the dead of the night  with panics and anxieties galore.. but listening to your vids in the background genuinely comforts me without fail. I just want you to know that I appreciate all your efforts  and I am so glad you're still around.  Wish me luck on my thesis hehe  I am going to need it. ;A;,hLfq42foTPo

@Diddyparty776,1,Playboi Carti isn't just a rapper; he's a cultural disruptor. His impact on modern hip-hop is undeniable  pushing boundaries with his experimental sound and unique fashion sense. Carti's music isn't always about lyrical complexity; it's about creating a vibe  an atmosphere. His use of ad-libs  distorted beats  and repetitive hooks is intentional  crafting a sonic landscape that's both hypnotic and chaotic. This distinctive approach has spawned countless imitators  but none have quite captured the same magic.  A huge part of Carti's appeal is his "aura." He's cultivated an enigmatic persona  rarely giving interviews and maintaining a strong sense of mystery. This carefully constructed image  combined with his undeniable charisma  makes him a captivating figure. His influence extends beyond music  shaping fashion trends and inspiring a generation of artists to embrace individuality and experimentation. Carti embodies a rebellious spirit  constantly reinventing himself and defying expectations.  Ultimately  whether or not you consider Playboi Carti the GOAT is subjective. But there's no denying his impact. He's a trendsetter  an innovator  and a true original. His willingness to take risks and his dedication to his unique artistic vision have solidified his place as one of the most influential artists of his generation. He's not just making music; he's creating a world  and people are drawn to that.,sKNw2GisF0o

@KairosGaming,136,Which Hypercharge you most HYPER for? Subscribe for Update Sneak Peeks! ► https://goo.gl/1qE15w,6_mHgMyo9I8
@wesloe,12,this is so hype  as a league player i’m already cooking up what could be good in the jungle  leon. seems absolutely broken  as well as brawlers with heavy cc like lou  ollie  kit  buzz. only thing i’m worried about is randoms not understanding the game and just running it down. I also think penny has crazy potential in lane  she can farm from a far and if its a melee brawler they can’t even walk up to last hit the minions. This will be very intresting i’m honestly so excited,6_mHgMyo9I8
@gbmarmalade2214,3,I wish they made the new rarity not unlockable with credits and only unlocked with starr drops,6_mHgMyo9I8

@agr0nianTV,1,A real shame that you can't use the opponent's super when using Willow. I would take that over immunity any day of the week.  Always weird to me when certain brawlers get screwed over stats-wise... like why does amber only get 15% speed and not have 15% shield...  Definitely excited to try the new modes and event!,6_mHgMyo9I8
@Before_Catz,1,One thing my friend said was the new rarity super legendary should be gotten for free at like 50k trophies like how brawlers used to be unlocked by trophies and then also once you got 50k trophies you got all characters and game gets extremely boring bc nothing new,6_mHgMyo9I8

@EmmanuelLeal-v3p,0,Hey  quick question  have you used the Minecraft dungeons or k cabinet because the cards on that cabinet that come out? The dispensers have item descriptions that have a lot of lower. That's not in the actual home version of the game. So may you want to look into that like how there's a card with a evoker with. Plated armor that was used by a supreme court member of the arch villagers  royal advisers,czUXT52zL70

@pvpgamer7993,0,Dan the best weapon is the helberd. It has great range decent attack speed and very high damage. You currently have a twin blade which is two handed  the helberd is two handed aswell  unless you rather have a one handed weapon and use shield  instead then use the rapier. I’ve been playing this mod pack recently and mobs can’t touch you with the helberd especially when you have the launch enchantment to launch mobs in the air,WKgJiPtcVZc
