@kalevipoeg6916,0,"You know, it never occurred to me until just now, but I whenever I'm at a pool, it IS super rare to see a black guy swimming there. Huh. We're talking public, modern pools that are free or cheap to enter, located in diverse areas in the U.S.. Do they just never go to these growing up? In fact....they seem to avoid water and boats in general. Is this like the thing with cats and water? Are they afraid it'll do something to their hair? Wash their lotion off?  I honestly want to know and nobody talks about it.

@FlowWithIt25,0,"I saved a UNLV Basketball player at a pool party in 1986. 30 people around, I was the only one that saw a 6 ft 11in. guy getting closer to the deep end of the pool. He instantly began to panic but his movememts were very slow. I dove in and pulled him up and over to the side of the pool. He burst into tears and was so thankful I was paying attention. He never learned to swim and didn't know the pool bottom dropped so fast. He grew up in a big city and never experienced being in a pool, nevermind learning the basics of swimming. He was also black.",R-kz3deX1uU
@WalterBJJohnson,0,"when i was 8 years old, my younger cousin and I would go to the hood boys club or that cloudy ass pool at the YMCA.

You either drowned or learned at that very moment ""how to swim!"" l can't say black people can't swim....i know a whole bunch of black fellas from my area that can swim like fishes thanks to those @$$holes!

@uniquechannelnames,0,"And it's not because black people are incapable of learning to swim obviously. It's because they have denser bones in general combined with perhaps more overall muscle mass, thus they sink more which makes an already insanely intense swimming test probably much harder",R-kz3deX1uU
@keemo5418,0,"Fun fact black bones are more density and stronger due to Africans being the oldest civilization has had the most time evolving, but with swim lessons thicker bones wont matter. Black americans had segregation end only 56 years ago. S/o to trump for bringing it back legally on the federal level, showing his true colors along with dei, & shipping out legal immigrants to concentration camps in el Salvador making the whole he is not racist argument exlusive to racists only left defending him. and the normalization of white only pools giving black people less experience in water and swim lessons not offered to black brown people access to the millions of public pools even after segragation ended. Public pools use jim crow laws in the south to keep black people out and intimidating to keep black people out in the north, they were scared the woman will mess with us more in the half naked settings with our God gifts hanging. This is  when the naacp kept sueing public pools, they won there forced thoses pools to let black people around the time ww2 ended and people got rich off it and free college which was kept away from black veterans and their families. The white people moved to white picket fenced neighborhood with indoor pools and black people stayed and they slowly shut down public pools and defunded them when black people were left. Poverty is racism and this country would rather have that as an excuse to be racists than black people successful. Why do you think its the old white exexutive running these labels and other black influence channels, lowering education standards and funding in public schools. Outright not teaching black people about their own history and try to hide it so they cant fight against the racism that is left from that time and genarational hate pased down.",R-kz3deX1uU
@shot.by.collenz6912,0,"I'M Black...Reminds me of summer camp at TOP OF THE PINES. The Lake had a dock with about 3 built in wooden pools made of the dock which let in lake water. It got deeper as you go to the 3rd pool.(this is where majority of kids swam). At the end of the dock was just the open Lake which you were allowed to swim after passing a long swim test and treading water for 20 mins.

@EdmurPortuga,0,"The Bottom Line of Human Morality 
The film’ s director Raymond Zhang and Dr. Wang Zhiyuan, president of the WOIPFG, attended the screening. In an interview, Wang Zhiyuan pointed out that the film reveals the CCP’s crime of live organ harvesting that has been going on since 1999, and called it an unprecedented evil. 

He said that although the issue was exposed in 2006, the public still does not know enough about it. Dr. Wang emphasized that this crime against humanity undermines the moral bottom line of humankind and as such, it is closely related to everyone. He called on the public to actively spread the truth and work together to stop this persecution. He said the film shows the core values of Truthfulness, Compassion, and Forbearance through real stories, bringing hope and strength to people.

After the screening, the film’s director, Peabody Award winner Raymond Zhang, answered questions from the audience. He talked about the bomb threats that several theaters in Taiwan received in October when they showed the film.

In a statement released on October 9, Taiwan’s Criminal Investigation Bureau said the bomb threats were sent from overseas IP addresses through VPN proxies. The bureau said no explosive devices were found in any theaters and called on the public to remain calm.

Raymond told The Epoch Times that he was born in China and still loves that land. He said his biggest hope is that people there can live safely.

For decades, China has been one of the most attractive destinations for organ transplant tourists, as Chinese hospitals often offer unusually short waiting times for organ matches. This phenomenon is possible because the CCP treats prisoners, mainly prisoners of conscience arrested for their beliefs, as a living organ bank.

In 2020, the London-based independent People’s Tribunal issued a full verdict after an 18-month investigation. The tribunal found that beyond reasonable doubt, the Chinese regime has forcibly harvested organs from prisoners of conscience for many years, with the main victims being Falun Gong practitioners.

Falun Gong, also known as Falun Dafa, is a spiritual meditation practice based on the principles of Truthfulness, Compassion, and Forbearance. Falun Gong practitioners have been brutally persecuted in China since 1999.",H5yAzD6IRwE

Nabil Hamati is interviewed after watching the film. 

Nabil Hamati, a Brooklyn resident who works in the medical field, said his feeling was beyond words. The film mentioned that young doctors were forced to harvest organs from living people right after graduation, which was hard for him to imagine. “Just like the man sitting on the sofa, he had to remove people’s eyeballs or watch others harvest kidneys from living people right after he graduated,” he said. “I hope this will not happen in the United States.”

The film also revealed the moving stories of the victims’ families in China who work tirelessly to find their missing relatives. This touched Nabil. “Although it is almost impossible, the love for family will never fade,” he said. “Even after 19 years, the old father passed away, he never gave up [seeking justice for] his children. This is a sad experience that you don’t want to happen to anyone.”

Nabil said that it is very important to know about the persecution in China. “We should cherish the freedom and rights we enjoy in the United States more, and at the same time try our best to help organizations like the World Organization to Investigate the Persecution of Falun Gong to expose these atrocities,” he said. “I hope that one day communism will become a thing of the past.” He added that this requires the joint efforts of many people, and as we see today, it is really difficult for one person to fight against an entire corrupt government. “Therefore, it is necessary to spread the truth and gather the power of everyone to help change the future,” Nabil affirmed. 

Nabil’s sister Maya Hamati is a college student. She said that the film is educational and reveals an important topic, reminding us to think further about these issues. She said this was extremely important because “in history [the Holocaust of the Jews], although people said ‘Never again,’ similar tragedies are still happening in the world.”",U7sNQqIuLUU

If they're between the age of 21-24 they understand.

If they're 25-34 they always get this ""I still got it!"" look

If they're 33-50 they know I'm being kind but it is flattering nonetheless

If they're 51+ they always give me a brief smile and either pull it out or say ""Can you give me a pass this time?"" Which is perfectly adequate. Even the best hollywood makeup can't cover up mannerisms and acting, so I'd just hand it over and say ""only because you're a sweetheart""

There are a few exceptions, like when they're busy or stressed, but it's also those some people that if you pop them the question (pun intended) they will usually step away from their stress and have a quick laugh for a few seconds.

For guys, ask for ID up until 34 or so. Older than 34 I give a pass.

But if they're white hair, old fox style, I always asked for ID (at least the first time) and they'd always just look at me disbelievingly 😂 and point at their hair.
