@theminicast6619,0,I honestly love Georgie. he's one of my favorite characters alongside meemaw. I swear it's all coming full circle. we're all talking about George Sr. buut  let's not forget this quote Meemaw made when he got Mandy Pregnant.  "Georgie  just think how you'd feel if someday somebody did that to your sister." he damn well started seeing things differently for the better. he will always be around to protect his sister even though she and him don't see eye to eye on something all the time. that's what siblings are for. and i'm saying that as a big sister. if I hear something like that is happening  I'd be at that door as well for my brothers and my sister.,UKjopZLMT0U

@unboxingtheworld1965,0,Even that was a test,R-kz3deX1uU
@FlowWithIt25,0,I saved a UNLV Basketball player at a pool party in 1986. 30 people around  I was the only one that saw a 6 ft 11in. guy getting closer to the deep end of the pool. He instantly began to panic but his movememts were very slow. I dove in and pulled him up and over to the side of the pool. He burst into tears and was so thankful I was paying attention. He never learned to swim and didn't know the pool bottom dropped so fast. He grew up in a big city and never experienced being in a pool  nevermind learning the basics of swimming. He was also black.,R-kz3deX1uU
@WalterBJJohnson,0,when i was 8 years old  my younger cousin and I would go to the hood boys club or that cloudy ass pool at the YMCA. The neighborhood thugs would come and sneak up on the younger kids and literally THROW us in the deep side of the pool and walk off tossing whoever was on the side of the pool. You either drowned or learned at that very moment "how to swim!" l can't say black people can't swim....i know a whole bunch of black fellas from my area that can swim like fishes thanks to those @$$holes! And when I got older  I helped keep the tradition alive!!,R-kz3deX1uU
@jessicaobrien3610,0,What a bunch of shit 😂,R-kz3deX1uU
@uniquechannelnames,0,And it's not because black people are incapable of learning to swim obviously. It's because they have denser bones in general combined with perhaps more overall muscle mass  thus they sink more which makes an already insanely intense swimming test probably much harder,R-kz3deX1uU
@keemo5418,0,Fun fact black bones are more density and stronger due to Africans being the oldest civilization has had the most time evolving  but with swim lessons thicker bones wont matter. Black americans had segregation end only 56 years ago. S/o to trump for bringing it back legally on the federal level  showing his true colors along with dei  & shipping out legal immigrants to concentration camps in el Salvador making the whole he is not racist argument exlusive to racists only left defending him. and the normalization of white only pools giving black people less experience in water and swim lessons not offered to black brown people access to the millions of public pools even after segragation ended. Public pools use jim crow laws in the south to keep black people out and intimidating to keep black people out in the north  they were scared the woman will mess with us more in the half naked settings with our God gifts hanging. This is  when the naacp kept sueing public pools  they won there forced thoses pools to let black people around the time ww2 ended and people got rich off it and free college which was kept away from black veterans and their families. The white people moved to white picket fenced neighborhood with indoor pools and black people stayed and they slowly shut down public pools and defunded them when black people were left. Poverty is racism and this country would rather have that as an excuse to be racists than black people successful. Why do you think its the old white exexutive running these labels and other black influence channels  lowering education standards and funding in public schools. Outright not teaching black people about their own history and try to hide it so they cant fight against the racism that is left from that time and genarational hate pased down.,R-kz3deX1uU
@shot.by.collenz6912,0,I'M Black...Reminds me of summer camp at TOP OF THE PINES. The Lake had a dock with about 3 built in wooden pools made of the dock which let in lake water. It got deeper as you go to the 3rd pool.(this is where majority of kids swam). At the end of the dock was just the open Lake which you were allowed to swim after passing a long swim test and treading water for 20 mins. I PASSED and although it was a big flex at summer camp as a kid  a lot of my friends at camp who were of different races couldn't pass the test.,R-kz3deX1uU

@paulryder5742,0,Wow. Adorable. ❤. In this country we have so much fighting. Black vs white.. LGBTQ vs whoever.. (il)legal immigrants vs ICE. Republicans vs democrats. Etc…… money has become a real issue for over 98% of Americans & that only exacerbates those social issues more & creates that national love with hate & segregation.   Through that fighting we need to stop & see the beauty that surrounds us. I.E. this video. How precious is this? It brought me to my childhood. We need to get all the skiski & pictures of these young woman wearing very little. All they so called beautiful people making the average person feel less than Or worthless. We need to play just heartwarming videos. I bet if we only played vids with just positive outcomes & beautiful kids doing adorable stuff like this  everything in this county would get better. Animals doing funny stuff. It makes me feel better. Someday maybe.,Y8QuG9HQeCQ

And listen before all the what about the little kids in the house comments…educate them on firearm safety. Hell they may be able to safe themselves then if you’re not home.,s2Ve3bHoLzc

@schadenfreudex3350,0,This type of reguarded stuff always makes me laugh.  'Oh no  a situation where seconds matter.

Please strange person at my door  give me a few minutes while I walk to the safe at the other end of my home  proceed to forget the combination because my adrenaline just dumped and my mind can't focus  finally remember the code but enter it twice incorrectly because my hands are shaking so badly. Great  I now have my pistol. I will now attempt to get the trigger lock off. Oh no  where did the wife put the key. Please strange person at the door  would you continue to wait patiently and not break the door down while I find this key? Great  I have found the key. I will now walk to the minimum legally allowed distance my magazine had to be placed away from my firearm. Please good sir  continue to wait.',s2Ve3bHoLzc

@H45556,0,My guess  the “peace out” is how they eventually catch the guy. Like they hear a suspect say it or see him sign something online with it. The line was delivered with way more importance and clarity than was necessary. You only do that if you need the audience to hear and remember it. He’ll say “peace out” right when the cops are gonna give up and they’ll detain him. Something like that,s2Ve3bHoLzc

@jetmanjayjay4604,1,He is wearing a colored attire darker than the person he hates. Therefore his problem is not the color of the skin but his dark heart and this is the problem with racism that many do not understand or talk about (Mathew 6:23  Mathew 15:19-20).,cw6EmhnQXTM

@louisgittings3708,1,I learned more about John Brown from listening to one of Frederick Douglass' autobiographies than I learned in school.  Of all the many men AND women  black and white  to include Abraham Lincoln  that Douglass met and knew  John Brown was he whom he respected AND loved most.    John Brown and those whites and blacks who rode with him to end the violent evil of slavery  should be celebrated as real American heroes.,cw6EmhnQXTM

The husband said  "I demand an apology for FARTING before my wife."  The drunk man said  "I am sorry. I did not realize that it was your wife's turn.",EDaSAXhgB7Q

@xuyahfish,1,It's not gender  it's nature. Recently went hiking on sandy terrain up a gorge. So MANY tourists not equipped with hiking boots were slipping  I reached out multiple times to help while my husband hung back.  It's just in some ppl's nature to be protective  tough & strong  while others are slower to react. Society needs both.  Some ppl call me too "fierce" in a normal setting  but need me in an emergency. I often feel that if I were a man  my "fierceness" would be more acceptable.,GV_jbmbtGrQ

@daringdarius5686,7,If a woman is buying cigarettes or alcohol (I used to work at a gas station throughout University) starts to look in their purse  to even remotely look for an ID I would/will always say "Ma'am  I'm going to need some proof your old enough to buy _____"  If they're between the age of 21-24 they understand.  If they're 25-34 they always get this "I still got it!" look  If they're 33-50 they know I'm being kind but it is flattering nonetheless  If they're 51+ they always give me a brief smile and either pull it out or say "Can you give me a pass this time?" Which is perfectly adequate. Even the best hollywood makeup can't cover up mannerisms and acting  so I'd just hand it over and say "only because you're a sweetheart"  There are a few exceptions  like when they're busy or stressed  but it's also those some people that if you pop them the question (pun intended) they will usually step away from their stress and have a quick laugh for a few seconds.  For guys  ask for ID up until 34 or so. Older than 34 I give a pass.  But if they're white hair  old fox style  I always asked for ID (at least the first time) and they'd always just look at me disbelievingly 😂 and point at their hair.
