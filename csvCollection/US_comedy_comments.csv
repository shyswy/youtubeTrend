@theminicast6619,0,I honestly love Georgie. he's one of my favorite characters alongside meemaw. I swear it's all coming full circle. we're all talking about George Sr. buut  let's not forget this quote Meemaw made when he got Mandy Pregnant.  "Georgie  just think how you'd feel if someday somebody did that to your sister." he damn well started seeing things differently for the better. he will always be around to protect his sister even though she and him don't see eye to eye on something all the time. that's what siblings are for. and i'm saying that as a big sister. if I hear something like that is happening  I'd be at that door as well for my brothers and my sister.,UKjopZLMT0U

I was watching season 6 the other day and there's this episode where the doctor basically turns into a crybaby begging for someone to help him.

@user89389,1,I tend to give snacks to the delivery drivers too. It's worth it  they always seem so happy! Even if it's just something small. I've had the best reactions to freshly baked muffins (I mean to be fair  who doesn't love freshly baked muffins).   Makes their day and makes mine too. Who knows what type of day they're having with all the crazy people out there. A little kindness doesn't cost much but can change a person's whole day and mood.  Also... there's an added benefit to it too because the delivery guys most definitely remember the ones who give them snacks. And they usually return the favour by being very considerate when delivering a package. It's a bonus win. :D,tvwKsRx16zo

@reddogged,2,I like how he said “to your NEW life” as if she could have lived one before  because fire can be “reborn” from “embers.” I never really noticed that before but the elements or just fire people could have reincarnation abilities,3d0Xrfm2M7s

@jmanfromthehills,0,The funniest part about this movie  is making the “persecuted and misunderstood minority viewed as dangerous” as literally fire  which is destructive and  dangerous as fuck to most of the other elements  so they are discriminatory not even for unfair reasons. The second funniest part about this is that Fire and Water simply cannot mix. They are polar opposites. Forcing the mixing of Fire and Water in real life leads to the fire being put out  or the water evaporating. One legit destroys the other. Its the funniest thing ever because the metaphor is about race relations ultimately. Incredible Mask Off moment for Hollywood. They Know that mixed “element” societies extinguish themselves and yet they will still promote them.,3d0Xrfm2M7s

@Syntex366,2,By the way  the reason that is very close to illegal is because even if you’re hired for a job where you’re requested to break into a server or something and report on how you did it so the company knows how to increase security  there’s a bunch of legal bs surrounding it where even in cases where you were explicitly hired and paid to do it  and you do so non-violently without harming or stealing information  you could still get tried in court for hacking them over a bunch of little technicals  which is beyond stupid  literally an irl surprised pikachu moment of a career to get sued for being paid to do something at their request.,jNOb8Zoi0Gw

@NTTP-rq4em,1,If she decides to become a vegetarian  support her and let her do whatever she wants. Let her buy vegetables and cook whatever she eats! Don't pay for that. Parents should support their children in every possible way. Not to be slaves and their children to be kings and queens!  Choosing gender  lifestyle... is an adult matter. Wait until age 18 to make a choice. Don't order your parents to follow your wishes when you're still a child and are living off your parents!,ZGwFd7TCSbw

@oliviabuttons4447,0,At my school we had this playboy pe teacher. Dirty blonde hair and i think blue eyes but his skin was orange and he was fit. I notice how weird he was when one of the girls in my group said she was creeped out by him. I first hand saw him flirting with her and touching unnecessary. One time he acted like he was rushing us out the bathroom but he kept staring at her smiling just watching her. One day we were running around the field and i notice the boys were acting weird laughing and stuff at the pe teacher. I noticed his arm under his other arm holding his phone which was recording a girl on the field. He kept gesturing us to keep going while smiling. The only reason he was caught is bc he was caught being intimate with a student by another student who walked into the room. There was no message or anything about what happened. Idek who the student was but huge chance she was under age but idk anything else. No cop involved either they just fired him.,uB4pyTU7SUc

@wizard8437,1,Apple pie with a side of some of the most disgusting and vile people to touch the planet in terms of time. Racist  bigoted  supremacists whose whole belief and superiority mindset is built off of pseudoscience and propaganda…  Gotta love the glorification and reminiscing of one of the most disgusting times in American history. Slavery and Jim Crowe are the ONLY TWO stains on America that every country points out and laughs at that we treated people as such.  Some people who shouldn’t even be alive today or have had offspring still allow racists and bigots to exist in their family.,xPBK4GKzV-s

@AtlasII2,0,Jesus died on the cross to pay the price of our sins so that whoever believes and put their faith in Him may be saved.  " For God so loved the world that he gave his one and only Son  that whoever believes in him shall not perish but have eternal life " John [3 : 16]  And Jesus is coming back soon. This is why we need to repent and change so that we may be ready for the day of the last judgment.  (Repentance isn't just saying sorry. It also means turning away from our sins.)   "You also must be ready therefore  for the Son of Man is coming at an hour when you do not expect Him." Matthew [24 : 44]  Choose well which path you will take.  “Enter by the narrow gate. For the gate is wide and the way is easy that leads to destruction  and those who enter by it are many. For the gate is narrow and the way is hard that leads to life  and those who find it are few." Matthew [7 : 13 - 14],xPBK4GKzV-s

@LaPaLaPa.,1,A lot of people are saying KSI is more genuine and interested than the other judges but it’s important to remember that he’s new to the show. His reactions feel fresh because he hasn’t been exposed to the over-the-top performances week after week  season after season. In this case someone like Simon having done this for years  might seem less reactive simply because he has seen it all before. It’s not necessarily that they don’t care; they may just be desensitized to the shock factor or theatrics that still feel wild to someone experiencing it for the first time.,qSpkeWAACZE
