@EdmurPortuga,0,"The Bottom Line of Human Morality 
The film’ s director Raymond Zhang and Dr. Wang Zhiyuan, president of the WOIPFG, attended the screening. In an interview, Wang Zhiyuan pointed out that the film reveals the CCP’s crime of live organ harvesting that has been going on since 1999, and called it an unprecedented evil. 

He said that although the issue was exposed in 2006, the public still does not know enough about it. Dr. Wang emphasized that this crime against humanity undermines the moral bottom line of humankind and as such, it is closely related to everyone. He called on the public to actively spread the truth and work together to stop this persecution. He said the film shows the core values of Truthfulness, Compassion, and Forbearance through real stories, bringing hope and strength to people.

After the screening, the film’s director, Peabody Award winner Raymond Zhang, answered questions from the audience. He talked about the bomb threats that several theaters in Taiwan received in October when they showed the film.

In a statement released on October 9, Taiwan’s Criminal Investigation Bureau said the bomb threats were sent from overseas IP addresses through VPN proxies. The bureau said no explosive devices were found in any theaters and called on the public to remain calm.

Raymond told The Epoch Times that he was born in China and still loves that land. He said his biggest hope is that people there can live safely.

For decades, China has been one of the most attractive destinations for organ transplant tourists, as Chinese hospitals often offer unusually short waiting times for organ matches. This phenomenon is possible because the CCP treats prisoners, mainly prisoners of conscience arrested for their beliefs, as a living organ bank.

In 2020, the London-based independent People’s Tribunal issued a full verdict after an 18-month investigation. The tribunal found that beyond reasonable doubt, the Chinese regime has forcibly harvested organs from prisoners of conscience for many years, with the main victims being Falun Gong practitioners.

Falun Gong, also known as Falun Dafa, is a spiritual meditation practice based on the principles of Truthfulness, Compassion, and Forbearance. Falun Gong practitioners have been brutally persecuted in China since 1999.",H5yAzD6IRwE

The second funniest part about this is that Fire and Water simply cannot mix. They are polar opposites. Forcing the mixing of Fire and Water in real life leads to the fire being put out, or the water evaporating. One legit destroys the other.

And Jesus is coming back soon. This is why we need to repent and change so that we may be ready for the day of the last judgment.
