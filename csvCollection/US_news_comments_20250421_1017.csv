@giovanni5063,1,It needs to be mentioned one more time. The Tariffs are paid for by the CONSUMER  not the seller. In this case  you  as the consumer are paying through the nose for the imported gadget. That is only the start! When the price of the Gadget or whatever  goes up  so then does the ever-present SALES TAX! You the CONSUMER has been screwed again without even a kiss on the cheek. All you MAGA folks are in for it just like everyone else.,5zQ0WewZY50

@harriswilliam7346,0,Huge fan of John Oliver but disappointed in this episode. While I agree with discussing trade deficits  he mentions nothing about how other countries have massive tariffs on American goods to protect their industries. Still  now that the United States is trying to do the same thing to protect American industries  it's a problem. Sure  the haphazard way in which he implemented it could have been done better  but I'm scratching my head as to why it wasn't mentioned and if most Americans are just not aware of this. I love cheap foreign goods just as much as the next guy  but there has to be a fair playing field. If other countries can protect their industries so can the United States.,5zQ0WewZY50

@yvonnes7412,0,Countries with less population may have money but they’re never going to need the quantities of goods that the 330 million Americans need… so there’s always going to be a trade imbalance… but the point is that the American people are the ones who benefit from trade because our country can’t produce all the goods in quantities to supply our massive population.   Like Florida and California produce SOME citrus fruits  but could they supply all 50 states for all 12 months? Nooooo,5zQ0WewZY50

@make_chile_great_again,1,Lo que quiere china es tener el monopolio mundial de productos y cuando lo tengan subirán los precios a lo que ellos quieran así que más que admirar a China hay que tenerles desconfianza  estados unidos no es una blanca paloma pero los países que conquisto y ayudo se volvieron potencia mundial de ejemplo : Japón  Corea del Sur  Alemania del oeste. Y no creo que si china conquista un país le pasara lo mismo y de muestra los contratos millonarios que presta a Sudamérica y Sudáfrica pero que los únicos licitantes que se ganan esos proyectos son empresas chinas y con una construcción pésima como lo hicieron en una hidroeléctrica ecuatoriana con problemas estructurales en los pocos años de haberse terminado.

This will not lessen the price of eggs  infact  this will make protests over egg prices become an illegal  and criminal act.  To my fellow americans who follow trump  wake up.

He or his bank is only standing up to protect his and the banks interests. He doesn't give one shit about the millions of struggling American families. This man would burn your house down if it brought in more money for the bank he would take your grandma's pension if he could.

@justcipher1618,0,Powell didn’t even use the letter "f".

@johnshite4656,0,I bet Trump has been at Powell's throat since January  and that now we just happen to finally be hearing about it. Trump will fire him and install a dove to end QT and return QE. When the firing happens initially there will be a big crash  but it will be short. Soon a replacement will be announced and then sentiment will get greedy again. We'll see another pump n dump in the markets  possibly a big one. When inflation comes back strong and the economy tanks the markets will resume their nosedive. This I prophesize. I expected something like this ever since Trump was elected back in NOV. The "cause" will be that markets are down  and it will be enough.,2GgRnPO4i60

@RuHo16,2,Very sad about what happened  but I would like to say something I have witnessed in my college. This goes to all the professors who like to take it too far with their political views. A year ago  I took a Sociology class  and the professor was a freak democrat. Every class period  he would show us articles that talked bad about republicans  cops  the military  the US  etc. Basically  it was all propaganda and biased info  and hateful comments. As an immigrant who doesn’t care about politics much  I will say that that class was the most stressful class I have ever taken. Behind me was a guy who had just returned from the military. He was very quiet and would leave the class whenever the professor made hateful comments. I don’t think there was a time I wasn’t shaking. The guy probably was the best person in the world  but knowing that he had just returned from military service and probably had PTSD  and hearing about all these school shootings that were happening  I was terrified. One time  the professor showed us a video on how the military is trained and brainwashed  and the songs they sang during the training  and the guy behind me got up very quickly  not happy at all  and left. That night  I thought I was gonna die  but he did not come back  and later he dropped the class. So please  leave your political sh*t at home. Teach us the things that you are being paid to teach  not propaganda. This goes for both sides.,WC8FrOl6_G0

@gaylec258,2,First time I have a complaint. I personally think you spent far too much time concentrating on Weatherford TX while numerous warnings were popping up for other locations. How many times do you have to tell the same area to take shelter because of a large tornado (that didn't have a PDS or Emergency tag). In this instance Ada  Ok was getting hit by a tornado   and you only quickly mentioned it before going back to Weatherford. Only time I've ever been disappointed with your choice of coverage.  I still think you do an awesome job   and all will highly recommend you.,wVebmilA2no

@somebodyelse5820,1,It’s the morning after now on Easter Day. I live north of Decatur about 30 miles and we only ever saw heavy heavy rain and some wind.

The immunity granted to individuals in positions of power should never shield them from facing justice for alleged crimes  including the 34 counts against Donald Trump. The Capitol Hill attack  a stark reminder of the dangers of extremism  underscores the need to address domestic threats with urgency and fairness. Classifying groups that incite violence as 'homegrown terrorists' is a step toward safeguarding democracy. Racism and hate crimes  which contradict the principles of equality enshrined in the Declaration of Independence  must be unequivocally outlawed to ensure justice for all ethnicities. Fiscal responsibility is equally vital; spending beyond our means jeopardizes the nation's future.

Biden and his puppeteers could not spend money fast enough on the most ridiculous things. Trump is doing the right thing with tariffs and there will be some pain…and it’s about time.  The country can’t keep printing and borrowing money to pay the interest  The last time we had a balanced. Budget was during the Clinton administration a result of Reganomics.  As Buffet says there needs to be a law passed that requires the budget to be balance year to year. Sach of _____ just want to raise taxes and ignore expenses of government.

@addalittleenglish824,0,Hey David  America finally waking up? Trump has been a Russian spy for about 38 years and counting. An ex-KGB chief: “In 1987 I worked in… the KGB of the USSR in Moscow… our department recruited the 40 year-old businessman from the USA  Donald Trump  nicknamed ‘Krasnov’.” That’s when Trump starts buying full-page ads attacking NATO. “Putin is doing a great job of outsmarting our country.” He says. Steele report: Russian operatives gathered damaging video evidence of perverted sex acts of presidential candidate in 2013  for blackmail. Mueller said “There were multiple  systematic efforts to interfere in our election.” Trump campaign had more than 140 contacts with Russian operatives  and Trump attempted to obstruct justice at least ten times. Campaign chair lied about then finally admitted to sharing info with Russian spy. Trump  ignoring US intelligence said: “…Putin  he just said it wasn’t Russia. I will say this  I don’t see any reason why it would be.” Secret meeting in Trump Tower with Russkies. Jared attempts to set up secret back channel to Russia in the Russian embassy. Trump to NATO member on prospect of Russian attack on their country “In fact  I would encourage them to do whatever the hell they want.” Trump: “If Putin likes Donald Trump… That’s called an asset…” Yeah  a Russian asset. FBI chief Kash Patel was paid $25 000 to appear in anti-FBI video by Russian backers. “The love in the air  I’ve never seen anything like it” Trump said of January 6 rioters  some of them cop-killers… “Russia if you’re listening…” “I think you will probably be rewarded mightily…” Yes  they own a seditious  treasonous felonious American president. Where do you think all those top secret docs in the bathroom ended up? Anonymous says they have evidence the election was hacked for Trump  using Starlink... Whistleblower at NLRB says 15 minutes after DOGE got busy in NLRB  Russia tried to log in  with DOGE passwords  via Starlink... Even before whistleblower filed complaint  he was threatened  along with drone footage of himself... All allegedly…,CVb4DkrEhmA

@shannawallace7855,22,Maybe this isn't your intention  but when you (or your mods on your behalf) automatically delete and block people in the chat if they make any mention at all of what's happening on another weather livestream (I'm talking about messages like "[storm chaser] has visual of the tornado on their stream" when you're talking about a radar-indicated tornado warning)  it comes across like you are more concerned about the possibility of losing viewers to a competitor's stream than people sharing info about the visual confirmation of an active tornado.   I totally understand that you can't show content from chasers you don't have a contract with and understand your decision not to acknowledge it if you can't confirm it yourself in the moment. But auto-blocking people for simply saying a competitor's name in your chat is not a great look  especially when it's in the context of people trying to relay information to others about a potentially life-threatening situation,vN-SjffhxDE

@adorabledeplorble8497,30,Ignacio Cruz-Mendoza was driving for Monique Trucking (and he was also not registered as a CDL holder in Mexico). He killed an off-duty truck driver (Scott Miller) and injured a handful of others  and at least one other injury was critical  yet Cruz-Mendoza was not injured. He left Cheyenne on June 11  not sure of his destination  and he did not know when his truck was last inspected (investigation showed it was four years prior). He was attempting to pass five vehicles in a 45mph zone (seven hours later) when he sideswiped them and caused a 14 hour road closure. He said his brakes went out  but there were skid marks at the scene and he was apparently not shifted into the right gear. He needed an interpreter in court. Somehow they listed everything as misdemeanor charges  gave him less than a year in jail  and even listed him as white in JeffCo jail. In July FMCSA declared his employer an imminent hazard to public safety after the leadership demonstrated a lack of knowledge of safety regulations (they had also had multiple violations within two years prior to this crash). Cruz-Mendoza had previously been pulled over in multiple states and also had at least one drug charge awhile back.  The number of failures in this entire story  including how any one station may breadcrumb the public by reporting on just a small piece of it  or how every agency involved may have done a crap ton more to ensure public safety  is all beyond insulting. That said  at least we are adding to his travels again and this actually did make the news. I am not an investigative reporter  but I was compelled to dig a little more on this last year. My only hope now is that our current administration can prevent him from returning again and that Scott Miller’s family and anyone else injured can now somehow find peace and healing.   This story deserves more than 28 seconds of air time and a little bit of shock and awe over the number of deportations.,PMYGkC9Fiqo

I wanted a special chair and found such a site and noticed that site offered a chair that looked very similar  and even the various parts for the chair so I could buy the casters for the chair and they would in fact fit on the chair I bought in my home nation.

@tonygibbs8214,1,I watched your video on the negative impact of technology… I taught physics and chemistry for over two decades … I remember cramming for exams and actually being annoyed if something I had focused on wasn’t asked   I had a addendum that allowed for credit if one presented a good argument and explanation of something on topic that wasn’t specifically discussed on the exam…during class if there was a question about something that comes up in class . In stead of telling them the answer I would challenge them to simply write a paragraph on it for the next day … after the school board  in their never ending odd decisions  decided albeit there are phones in every classroom snd kids are supervised all day … they need their phones for personal safety !!! Total distraction plus the scores have consistently dropped as when one has spent the night “in the stacks “ doing research … we worked hard for that information and it stuck with us becayse of the effort involved in attaining it..  now ANY question has 44000 sources with  answers in nano seconds … no effort began to equal no learning  And IT IS GETTING WORSE  todays students have never had more information at their finger tips but they are dumb as rocks !!

@Frank_The_Tank72,1,That launch was appalling to real astronauts. Making this a narcissistic PR event is disgraceful. They sounded like a a bridal party in a stretch limo. Gayle King is pissy because all of us thought it was tacky and she can’t handle it. If they really cared about woman and being role models  why didn’t those elite rich women sponsor actual young aspiring women that want to be astronauts? Regular women that have studied space and that have no income to just take a random ride up there. Nope  instead it was all about these ego driven broads that needed more narcissistic supply added to their résumé. They do nothing for women’s movement except moved it back a few paces.,-QFZaoPWNzM
