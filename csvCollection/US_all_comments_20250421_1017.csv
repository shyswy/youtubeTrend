@TannerSidetrax,11,Mumbo  just wanted to say I have been a long time viewer of yours (likely over ten years now) and it made me super happy to see you in the movie and had a good chuckle seeing what the costume department did to you.  I went to see the movie opening weekend with my girlfriend and her two kids (6 and 8) and we just had the best time. There wasn't a frown in theatre  and both of the kids were so excited to see the movie and super pleased afterwards. It was a really great memory we were able to create as her kids and I are really able to connect over our mutual love of Minecraft. Thank you to you  Jared Hess and everyone else who really made something everyone can enjoy. The production team couldn't have asked for a better redstone consultant. You deserved this.,GTAGFUy25J4

@artontherun,0,Minecraft 2 plot spoilers: endermen accidentally venture into the real world after realizing they can't inhabit this dimension without taking over the body of a human. First to be possessed: Mumbo Jumbo. Alex and Steve must venture to the end  defeat Lord Ender and save the real world from being taken over by endermen.,GTAGFUy25J4
@irrelEvant5352,0,Sams? No thats flak,GTAGFUy25J4
@StarBeam500,0,It's very cool that mumbo actually had an effect on the movie and wasn't just a cameo. However  his one main addition  the cactus canons  just felt like an odd choice setting-wise  considering they were in a cave.,GTAGFUy25J4
@sctoast2483,254,I just can't look at 400 times the same after Quincy Wilson came into the scene. Nothing looks impressive anymore 😭,VX-7ULUrssc
@Ghostmanriding,113,Good to see the top three  Robinson  Patterson and Boling under 45 sec.,VX-7ULUrssc
@da5863,99,Erriyon ran 45.37 earlier this month so he was definitely just not at his best due to running an hour before. You have to give respect where it’s due though  Fred Kerley  Letsile Tebogo  and Michael Norman are in a league of their own having run world class times from the 100 all the way up to the 400.,VX-7ULUrssc
@SPIDERM0OSE,75,I wanna see Kerley n Lyles beefing n having showdowns over 300m,VX-7ULUrssc
@gtrdoc911,53,Love it when sprinters are humbled by the 400.,VX-7ULUrssc
@markadams7328,37,Thanks for not making this a 14 minute video!! 4 minutes was plenty to get your point across.,VX-7ULUrssc
@kwd-2023,28,Boling  WOW! Love that guys runs!,VX-7ULUrssc
@christophersmith3254,26,I think it's dope to see them competing without fear,VX-7ULUrssc
@TheGreatness-gg1jx,17,Noah and Erriyon should run more 4s. It'll drop their 200 times significantly.  Shout out to Boling finding his stride. Good to see him finding his groove.,VX-7ULUrssc
@Xx-po1fu,13,This is so silly  if Lyles had ran under 10 seconds in the 100m and under 20 seconds in the 200m at the Grand Slam event he would be $200 000 richer. This Tom Jones Memorial Invitational does not provide prize money for the winners.,VX-7ULUrssc
@davidhunternyc1,13,Will any one person ever own world records in the 100m  200m  and 400m? An Olympic Gold medal in all three races would be genius level too.,VX-7ULUrssc
@anselmolawrence839,12,The 400 is a big man race,VX-7ULUrssc
@dalilkwickone14,12,Noah looks bulky,VX-7ULUrssc
@kennethwoods6525,11,Ummmm. Did Fred Kerley just run 44.73 at Mt. Sac?,VX-7ULUrssc
@crosslink1493,10,Lyles could run faster.  I'm not sure if its his conditioning or if he needs to work on his pacing through the race.  Good to see the former 'wonderkid' Matthew Boling get under 45 in April  and also good going to the other two who got down in the 44s.,VX-7ULUrssc
@johnthies1150,9,Aren't you gonna cover Shelly Ann Frasier Price's complete domination at her son's sports day parents race? 😂,VX-7ULUrssc
@SkyTurnsPurplePhotography,9,Lyles is not a 400m guy  but I am sure he was satisfied getting to stretch his legs and see where he was at.   -Doubt he'll run another one anytime soon.,VX-7ULUrssc
@darrylb5247,8,I predict Boling to drop to 44.0 by the end of this year. He's still young and finishes well!,VX-7ULUrssc

@Katana314,1,Might be a fun time to talk about a character I'm writing for a book: A blind lawyer  top in his country  that often shows off his hearing capabilities in unnecessary ways. But  he's ego-driven  gluttonous  occasionally loses sight of justice  and overestimates himself as being capable of doing everything sighted people can do. "Did Lambird impress you with that juggling trick?" "Yeah." "I wasn't supposed to tell you  but he spent the entire last day practicing it  and cursing out loud every time he failed. The office below us sent in a complaint about all the balls bouncing on their ceiling.",0HeX7NmWmho
@Dexrazor,1,I recently read the Nevernight trilogy where a side character that was a blind swordsman was incredibly skilled. They answered why he was so deadly in the last book and I didn't expect the real answer at all but it made a lot of sense.,0HeX7NmWmho

@mardemo2869,0,“For God loved the world so much that he gave his only Son so that anyone who believes in him shall not perish but have eternal life” John 3:16. Jesus died and resurrected so YOUR sins could be forgiven. He loves you so much He suffered and gave His life for you so you may believe in Him and have eternal life. Change your heart and turn to Jesus. “Jesus said to him  ‘I am the way  the truth  and the life. No one comes to the Father except through Me.’” John 14:6. Jesus is the answer to all things and the only way to have true peace and eternal life after this world.,9OPyZMVBO9o

@longship44,1,I have been a fan of Fantastic Four since I was a kid and I've been waiting for this movie to be made for decades  but unfortunately  Marvel has decided to mess with the main characters and gender swap out Silver Surfer for some ungodly reason. This is an insult to those of us that actually care about these characters and the original Kirby and Stan Lee story. I will not be taking my family to this in the movie theater. Any serious fan of FF and Silver Surfer shouldn't spend a penny on this piece of 💩.,pAsmrKyMqaA

@darkisis22,9,10:31 bartender here  I love this part! Haha  the “awaken” technique with herbs is actually a thing!  You take mint or herb of choice and gently slap it against your palm or in the side of the glass to release its oils - it’s a more subtle way of muddling. 😎  hope you had a blast at Coachella,2vnbxNgHW1Y

@marielinderholm5767,1,Actually they weren't wrong  peanuts are not a nut. They are the worst name though because so many people assume they are a nut because of the name. Almonds are not a nut either. So if you are allergic to nuts you can eat peanuts and almonds. If you are allergic to all of them you might need to be more explicit about it in restaurants and similar places 😊,bxlzbJPvwK8

@Quickeeeee,1,Sweets really is the case of: you want it when you can't have (much of) it. When I was a student I bought sweets all the time to keep up... And after I graduated I didn't buy sweets for like two years. It just lost its appeal. And I still  many years later  don't like things that are just sweet; I only want things that have a strong flavor of something else like coco or lemon. And yeh I know sugar addiction is real  but I guess for me the association between sugar and studying was so strong and off-putting that I just didn't fall for the addiction.,bxlzbJPvwK8

@madelinebancroft5910,0,I used to work at Crumbl cookie and people were NOT careful about cross contamination when it came to nut based cookies. I always did my best to remind them to use different spatulas or clean them off between. But genuinely they are more concerned about how quickly you fill orders  not how careful you are with food allergens. If someone called said they had a severe allergy I would tell them not to buy them.,bxlzbJPvwK8

@Mariamimaria,369,Antonelli attends school.  Like  after the quali  he might open a book and study for the test with his classmates.  We don't notice that he's right behind the best in the field on his first F1 experience  without crashing on a circuit where the pros and everyone touches the wall every now and then.  This young driver is incredibly talented.,lmBm1ATl2m8
@Ahdiasweet,68,Schumacher  Senna  Lauda  and now Verstappen.,lmBm1ATl2m8

@jeffthiessen8829,1,Williams competing in the top 10 is crazy and Carlos gets absolutely no coverage.  What’s with the F1 ?  This is a big move but clearly not in the F1 favourites .  Well us Carlos fans would like to see it!,lmBm1ATl2m8
@Aposalon,1,I though max gave up on figthting for the championship i was very wrong,lmBm1ATl2m8

@niueanlaho,1,Moses is very good  but he is no beast like Iron Mike....,4Q4nDw1D8kg
@badbob4546,1,Ty 4 the video  well done! I'm a bit out of sorts 4 now  I'm a disabled veteran with P.T.S.D. and it takes it's toll at times  so please forgive me 4 not being as updated as a True boxing fan should be. This young man seems 2 have some pretty good skills so far  but he has some learning 2 do just yet. I do wish him well tho and I'll be watching on the sidelines.,4Q4nDw1D8kg
@angrymango5426,1,Tyson was so much better,4Q4nDw1D8kg
@7415_Gamer,1,Mike Tyson at this age was beating able black fighter and not these tomato boxers,4Q4nDw1D8kg
@dougnewmanmusic1,0,His opponents here don't look too impressive but he certainly has a lot to do with that. On top of his hand speed and power  he looks like Ali a bit avoiding punches with his balance and foot speed.,4Q4nDw1D8kg
@KVLMSYSTEM678,0,Come to America you'll see 😂 Legendary Mike Tyson is 1 of 1 not comparable.,4Q4nDw1D8kg
@PiscineChat72,0,Le comparer à Tyson !? Un peu fort. Tyson 19 ans  19 Combats  19 KO  pour le 20ème combat il affrontait  Jummy Tiilis et pour la première fois il gagnait aux points. N'empêche que Tillis est allé au tapis. Tyson  Meilleur boxeur de tous les temps et Ali la légende.,4Q4nDw1D8kg

@boris1104,0,This man Itauma is fun to watch  quite refreshing for a big man  fast  powerful  young and hungry. BUT - he has been fighting 2nd and 3rd class bums all the time. He has not proved himself yet.,4Q4nDw1D8kg
@ciprianlucaci1270,0,no it will not be,4Q4nDw1D8kg
@daimionhollins528,0,I will not compare these two  like some average Joe comparing apples and oranges 😔 Tyson was on a different plateau  when he destroyed nearly the majority of his competition. Not taking anything away from the youngster .. he's a beast in his own right 👍,4Q4nDw1D8kg
@adrianvasquez7320,0,Y'all compare lightweights to Tyson nowadays... Is ridiculous.,4Q4nDw1D8kg
