@ーテイル,1,THIS! This is how you write the doctor panicking! He's in panic  but he doesn't beg nor does he cry  he tries to witt his way out of the situation.   I was watching season 6 the other day and there's this episode where the doctor basically turns into a crybaby begging for someone to help him. All so a random character could get a small "gotcha" moment.   It genuinely made me angry.,4wOpPxrcUsM

@user89389,1,I tend to give snacks to the delivery drivers too. It's worth it  they always seem so happy! Even if it's just something small. I've had the best reactions to freshly baked muffins (I mean to be fair  who doesn't love freshly baked muffins).   Makes their day and makes mine too. Who knows what type of day they're having with all the crazy people out there. A little kindness doesn't cost much but can change a person's whole day and mood.  Also... there's an added benefit to it too because the delivery guys most definitely remember the ones who give them snacks. And they usually return the favour by being very considerate when delivering a package. It's a bonus win. :D,tvwKsRx16zo

@wizard8437,1,Apple pie with a side of some of the most disgusting and vile people to touch the planet in terms of time. Racist  bigoted  supremacists whose whole belief and superiority mindset is built off of pseudoscience and propaganda…  Gotta love the glorification and reminiscing of one of the most disgusting times in American history. Slavery and Jim Crowe are the ONLY TWO stains on America that every country points out and laughs at that we treated people as such.  Some people who shouldn’t even be alive today or have had offspring still allow racists and bigots to exist in their family.,xPBK4GKzV-s

@AtlasII2,0,Jesus died on the cross to pay the price of our sins so that whoever believes and put their faith in Him may be saved.  " For God so loved the world that he gave his one and only Son  that whoever believes in him shall not perish but have eternal life " John [3 : 16]  And Jesus is coming back soon. This is why we need to repent and change so that we may be ready for the day of the last judgment.  (Repentance isn't just saying sorry. It also means turning away from our sins.)   "You also must be ready therefore  for the Son of Man is coming at an hour when you do not expect Him." Matthew [24 : 44]  Choose well which path you will take.  “Enter by the narrow gate. For the gate is wide and the way is easy that leads to destruction  and those who enter by it are many. For the gate is narrow and the way is hard that leads to life  and those who find it are few." Matthew [7 : 13 - 14],xPBK4GKzV-s

@TheSkateLurk,0,Let the kids make a mess  charge a premium to see the Minecraft movie to cover the addition labor cleaning the theater. Offer overtime to the employees who dedicate to the Minecraft movie theaters.   $5 extra per ticket  100 seats  $500 per sold out show. Can probably do 5-6 showing per screen a day. $2500. Overtime comp per employee a day is like $22-25/hr or $200 for a full days work. 4 employees per theater for cleaning. Boom. $1500  kids get to be kids  employees who want higher pay get it  profit for the theater.,HCqqUqopI8I

@satisfyingytvids,2,not me trynna find out why everyone thinks the trick is real just to come here and see everyone glazing KSI’s reaction skills,qSpkeWAACZE
@LaPaLaPa.,1,A lot of people are saying KSI is more genuine and interested than the other judges but it’s important to remember that he’s new to the show. His reactions feel fresh because he hasn’t been exposed to the over-the-top performances week after week  season after season. In this case someone like Simon having done this for years  might seem less reactive simply because he has seen it all before. It’s not necessarily that they don’t care; they may just be desensitized to the shock factor or theatrics that still feel wild to someone experiencing it for the first time.,qSpkeWAACZE
