Trust in him and have faith that it will be done. Nothing in the is world can take away what you gone through and suffered. This world only provides temporary comfort.

@sonters,1,"I've never been good at analyzing symbolism, but here's my interpretation: classic hoodie Gura is a representation of memories of her past; the fun she had in the first few years of HoloEN. The Greek outfit version is Gura now, frustrated with the direction of the company and wanting to leave, which is represented by the door. The ships coming to block the path to the door could be Holo managers/higher-ups trying to convince her to stay. What causes the Greek outfit Gura to hesitate at the door is the good times she had at the start of it all. She attempts to suppress those happy memories, casting hoodie Gura into the depths. I think the other members of Myth appearing is meant to show their support for Gura wanting to leave, allowing present Gura to realize that leaving doesn't get rid of the good memories, and that her friends will always be by her side. 

Whether or not my interpretation is ""correct"" (if the interpretation of a viewer CAN be considered correct or not), it's obvious that Gura has been suffering for a long time now. No matter what she does in the future, I just hope she can find happiness and live a long and healthy life. Thank you for everything, shork. I hope our paths cross again 💙",twUFbqyul_M

@EdmurPortuga,0,"Reserving a Theater for More Screenings
One audience member said, “Many people are numb to the CCP—they are brainwashed, indulge in comfort, and don’t care about Taiwan’s crisis.”

Mr. Li said that many young people watched the film, realized their responsibilities, stood up to support it, and even booked a theater for more screenings. One man booked a theater in Kaohsiung, and Mr. Guan, the head of Lion Films, went to Kaohsiung to discuss the film after it was screened.

Evil Will Never Prevail Over Good
Mr. Li continued, “Taiwan has democracy, freedom, peace, and kindness, and is a kind and blessed land. Taiwanese people believe in divine beings. I absolutely believe that Taiwan will not be ruled by the CCP, because heaven has been watching over it since ancient times.

“Falun Gong’s principles of Truthfulness, Compassion, and Forbearance are a powerful force in society. I believe that the power of good will definitely defeat evil, and evil will never prevail over good. The CCP is afraid because divine beings are helping us, and good will prevail over evil is an eternal truth.”

He recommended audience members read two books: Irrefutable Evidence and Nine Commentaries on the Communist Party. He said, “The Nine Commentaries on the Communist Party thoroughly exposes the nature of the communist party and is worth reading.”

Stand Up to Support and Spread the Truth
Dr. Cheng Cheng-bing said, “This film screening is very successful. It’s great! I’m very moved!” He gave a thumbs up and said, “We are very grateful to Falun Gong practitioners, The Epoch Times, Sound of Hope, and other media outlets that report on this. You are all dedicated and selfless, which is really amazing.”

@DoOdleIsMe,1,"Hello Glitch productions. You might not ever see this, but As an animator I truly respect you guys and your amazing hard work. Many people have been asking for digital circus but not giving this show any attention for its storyline and amazing style. As for the characters I truly believe they have potential in the show to grow on the viewers. Maybe some of the viewers are to used to their colorful cartoony characters over at TADC. Not saying the show is bad. But simply stating that that show grabbed a different audience who may or may not enjoy this show as much as they do TADC. Which I personally love both! They’re both very unique and I love them very much for how they stand out from any other show I’ve watched. To put it simply, the people who comment; when is the next TADC episode coming out? And don’t give any respect or attention to any other animations you guys put out there. Clearly aren’t loving you for your hardwork. They only want the shows because they enjoy them for what they are. Not what it can become. And gaslight district is a show I know can grow a fan base just like TADC. Not saying everyone whose watched TADC aren’t enjoying this either. But I’ve seen a recent post looking at comments towards this series. And honestly it deserves more respect for its creativity and amazing characters. If you did take the time to read this. I thank you for your hard work and love the animations!

It feels like a big risk to have all your lead characters be girls but you have proven me wrong. So glad to see you showing people (myself included) that it isn't about the gender of the character, but HOW THEY ARE WRITTEN.

It stated that Falun Gong, a religious group from China, has been persecuted in China for 25 years. The group has a lot of evidence to prove that thousands of Falun Gong practitioners have been detained in the CCP’s prisons for adhering to their beliefs, and a large number of practitioners have been tortured.

@EdmurPortuga,0,"Company Refuses to Rent the Venue
On February 28, the exhibition company did not produce legal written proof of the source of the bodies. Therefore, the exhibition hall in Randers (Arena Randers) decided not to rent the venue, thus the body exhibition in Randers was not held.

Mainstream Media: The Source of the Body Exhibition Specimens Is Not Known
On February 28, the Danish newspaper Christian Daily carried an article titled, “Dead bodies are on display in Danish cities. No one can answer where they come from” on the front page of the newspaper and the website. The article said there were questions about where the corpses came from.


Danish newspaper Christian Daily carried an article questioning the source of the bodies.

It stated that Falun Gong, a religious group from China, has been persecuted in China for 25 years. The group has a lot of evidence to prove that thousands of Falun Gong practitioners have been detained in the CCP’s prisons for adhering to their beliefs, and a large number of practitioners have been tortured. In 2006, it was discovered that many practitioners had their organs harvested [while they were] alive and trafficked. Many Danish people said they were worried that these human specimens on display were from Chinese prisoners.",_8DA0ZQmSmc

Morten Messerschmidt, Danish MP (Member of Parliament) and chairman of the People’s Party (Dansk Folkeparti) was shocked by the exhibition. On February 7, he asked the Minister of Health several questions about the law, ethics and China’s use of political prisoners’ organs:


Morten Messerschmidt, MP and chairman of the People’s Party, asked the Minister of Health questions about ethical issues regarding the body exhibition.

Question 275: “Can you explain what permits and legal procedures are required for the exhibition of human remains in Denmark and whether the exhibition of human remains complies with applicable laws?”

Question 276: “Can the Minister explain how the use of human remains in exhibitions should ensure the consent of the deceased or their relatives? “

Question 277: “Will the Minister comment on the ethical considerations in connection with the commercial use of human bodies in exhibitions such as Human-Bodies, including whether the current rules are sufficient, or whether there should be stricter rules for such exhibitions in Denmark?”

Question No. 278: “Will the Minister investigate whether he is aware of similar exhibitions of human bodies internationally that are related to lack of consent or illegal trade, and whether the Minister will investigate human bodies in this regard? In this context, is the Minister aware of China’s use of organs from political prisoners?”

Søren Espersen, a senior member of the Danish Democratic Party (Danmarksdemokraterne) and chairman of the Religious Committee, asked the Minister of Culture on February 19: “Can it be determined with certainty that all bodies and body parts are donated voluntarily, do not originate from, for example, executed prisoners in dictatorships, or originate from illegal organ trafficking?”


Søren Espersen, a senior member of the Danish Democratic Party, asked the Minister of Culture about the bodies.

“The exhibition has been criticized in several places because of doubts that the bodies were not all donated voluntarily and for a clear purpose,” Thomas Krarup, director of health, culture and care in the city of Randers, wrote in a notification to government authorities.",JAd4K-Bgde0

@TheNyxmaster,3,"Always been a big Superman fan — never really got into the whole DC Universe with all the heroes mixed together. But James Gunn's got a solid track record.
This movie feels like a tightrope walk: it could go full epic, Avengers-level hype, and leave us begging for more… or crash hard and bury the last hope we had for Superman for the next 30–40 years.
Let’s be real — superhero films are in a bit of a slump right now. This one could either reignite the spark… or be the nail in the coffin.",Rq5LyXG8m2U

@EdmurPortuga,0,"The documentary State Organs was screened in Tokyo on March 26, 2025. Canadian human rights lawyer David Matas gave a lecture at the event as part of the effort to raise awareness of the Chinese Communist Party’s (CCP) forced organ harvesting of prisoners of conscience. The screening of State Organs aims to expose the human rights violations in China, increase public attention to the issue of forced organ harvesting, and promote cooperation within the international community to help bring an end to the atrocity and protect people’s lives and dignity.

The film took about seven years to produce and documents the CCP’s forced organ harvesting from Falun Gong practitioners, who have been violently persecuted by the CCP since 1999. The film, which includes eyewitness accounts, opens with the shocking testimony of former surgeon Mr. Zheng Zhi, who witnessed the live organ harvesting. In addition, the film features recordings of overseas human rights activists who posed as patients and called Chinese hospitals to inquire about the speed of organ transplants and whether the organs came from Falun Gong practitioners.

The documentary also depicts the pain of the families of missing Falun Gong practitioners: a father tries every means possible to save his son; a brother mentally prepares himself to face the news of his brother’s death. The audience was deeply moved by these stories.

State Organs director Zhang Yongjin explained that forced organ harvesting is just one facet of the CCP’s genocidal campaign against Falun Gong. He said that as long as the totalitarian regime continues, human rights violations will be covered up and the number of victims will continue to increase.",2vnbxNgHW1Y

Referencing talented artists rocks, art is made to inspire and to be shared and reinterpreted, but credit them ffs. You would know Sasha's work if you saw it, this MV is a direct reference and could've been such an awesome boost to his work and career, and still can be!!!

@EdmurPortuga,0,"People Sign the Petition to Oppose the CCP’s Forced Organ Harvesting



People sign the petition to condemn the CCP’s forced organ harvesting.

On February 22, a woman in Horsens said, “I feel bad. These dead people have no dignity. They are treated like animals by the butchers. They have no identity, no age, no proof, no statement of their wishes before death, or whether they agree to their bodies being exhibited.”

After a young man signed the petition from the Doctors Against Forced Organ Harvesting (DAFOH). He said, “My mother just saw the exhibition and took your materials home. After reading the materials carefully, she was shocked and asked me to sign for her. I hope to do my part to support Falun Dafa practitioners’ just actions against the persecution and against organ harvesting.”

On March 2 in the port city of Frederikshavn, two female doctors working in a hospital saw the problems of the body exhibition clearly with their professional expertise. One said, “As a doctor, I understand the structure of the human body and can see that some of the human specimens have traces of injuries on the bones, indicating that the deceased may have been tortured. Moreover, these corpses are not marked with their source, age, cause of death, purpose of the donor, and other detailed information.

“From these two points I see, I know what you said is true. These human specimens are questionable.”

They talked to Falun Gong practitioners who came to the body exhibition to raise awareness of human rights persecution in China and said, “We understand your concerns and support your righteous actions.” They signed the DAFOH petition to support the effort to expose forced organ harvesting.

At noon, four middle-aged people drove to the exhibition. A practitioner told them, “The exhibition organizer did not show evidence of where these bodies came from. The CCP is currently persecuting Falun Gong and other dissidents, and removing their organs while they are alive for huge profits. These corpse specimens all look like Asians. They are likely to be prisoners of conscience in China, suffering cruel persecution by the CCP’s dictatorship.”

After they quietly listened, they took the materials and walked into the exhibition hall. But they soon came out.

One of them said, “We changed our minds and decided not to buy tickets to see the exhibition. We do not support such an exhibition.” They signed the petition and thanked practitioners.

A couple came out of the exhibition hall and were about to get in their car, when a practitioner told them that the human specimens might be from prisoners of conscience in China, and their organs might have been harvested alive. They were shocked. The woman’s eyes filled with tears and the couple signed the petition.

After seeing the exhibition, many people signed the petition. Some said, “What you said is true. I support you in exposing the persecution and the organ harvesting.” People talked with practitioners for a long time, and said they wanted to know more about the persecution.

Many people asked what they could do to help. A practitioner said, “Your signature is a support for us. You can tell your friends and relatives that the CCP persecutes Falun Gong practitioners and other innocent people, and harvests human organs on a large scale and in an organized manner to make huge profits. The bodies in this exhibition might be from prisoners of conscience in China. Let more people know the truth, and we can stop the persecution in China as soon as possible.”

People were deeply concerned by the cruel human rights violations. Some people suggested that citizens should call for legislation in Denmark so that such controversial exhibitions can be prevented from being held in Denmark in the future.",MfPI3AWgV_0

@EdmurPortuga,0,"People Sign the Petition to Oppose the CCP’s Forced Organ Harvesting



People sign the petition to condemn the CCP’s forced organ harvesting.

On February 22, a woman in Horsens said, “I feel bad. These dead people have no dignity. They are treated like animals by the butchers. They have no identity, no age, no proof, no statement of their wishes before death, or whether they agree to their bodies being exhibited.”

After a young man signed the petition from the Doctors Against Forced Organ Harvesting (DAFOH). He said, “My mother just saw the exhibition and took your materials home. After reading the materials carefully, she was shocked and asked me to sign for her. I hope to do my part to support Falun Dafa practitioners’ just actions against the persecution and against organ harvesting.”

On March 2 in the port city of Frederikshavn, two female doctors working in a hospital saw the problems of the body exhibition clearly with their professional expertise. One said, “As a doctor, I understand the structure of the human body and can see that some of the human specimens have traces of injuries on the bones, indicating that the deceased may have been tortured. Moreover, these corpses are not marked with their source, age, cause of death, purpose of the donor, and other detailed information.

“From these two points I see, I know what you said is true. These human specimens are questionable.”

They talked to Falun Gong practitioners who came to the body exhibition to raise awareness of human rights persecution in China and said, “We understand your concerns and support your righteous actions.” They signed the DAFOH petition to support the effort to expose forced organ harvesting.

At noon, four middle-aged people drove to the exhibition. A practitioner told them, “The exhibition organizer did not show evidence of where these bodies came from. The CCP is currently persecuting Falun Gong and other dissidents, and removing their organs while they are alive for huge profits. These corpse specimens all look like Asians. They are likely to be prisoners of conscience in China, suffering cruel persecution by the CCP’s dictatorship.”

After they quietly listened, they took the materials and walked into the exhibition hall. But they soon came out.

One of them said, “We changed our minds and decided not to buy tickets to see the exhibition. We do not support such an exhibition.” They signed the petition and thanked practitioners.

A couple came out of the exhibition hall and were about to get in their car, when a practitioner told them that the human specimens might be from prisoners of conscience in China, and their organs might have been harvested alive. They were shocked. The woman’s eyes filled with tears and the couple signed the petition.

After seeing the exhibition, many people signed the petition. Some said, “What you said is true. I support you in exposing the persecution and the organ harvesting.” People talked with practitioners for a long time, and said they wanted to know more about the persecution.

Many people asked what they could do to help. A practitioner said, “Your signature is a support for us. You can tell your friends and relatives that the CCP persecutes Falun Gong practitioners and other innocent people, and harvests human organs on a large scale and in an organized manner to make huge profits. The bodies in this exhibition might be from prisoners of conscience in China. Let more people know the truth, and we can stop the persecution in China as soon as possible.”

People were deeply concerned by the cruel human rights violations. Some people suggested that citizens should call for legislation in Denmark so that such controversial exhibitions can be prevented from being held in Denmark in the future.",4Q4nDw1D8kg
