@pppp-q1g9u,6,"As a Chinese farmer, I take immense pride in my ancestral heritage. In ancient China, we agriculturalists held esteemed social standing second only to scholar-officials, surpassing even merchants and artisans. This reflected our civilization's agricultural essence - China stood as humanity's greatest agrarian society, where statecraft fundamentally meant ensuring ""no subject suffers hunger, let alone perishes from starvation."" Remarkably, this farming-based civilization gifted mankind countless revolutionary innovations we still cherish:

**Technological Marvels**  
‚Ä¢ Papermaking, gunpowder, compass, and printing (Four Great Inventions)  
‚Ä¢ World's first armillary sphere (Han Dynasty astronomical instrument)  
‚Ä¢ Zhang Heng's seismoscope (132 AD earthquake detector)  
‚Ä¢ Earliest balance thermoscope (Western Han temperature measurement)  
‚Ä¢ Song Dynasty ""Sky-piercing cannons"" (rocket prototypes)  
‚Ä¢ 4,000-year-old binary system (from I Ching)  
‚Ä¢ Millennium-leading pi calculations  

**Agricultural & Scientific Pioneering**  
‚Ä¢ First rice/millet cultivation ‚Ä¢ Initial coal/petroleum utilization  
‚Ä¢ World's earliest star catalog (Gan Shi) ‚Ä¢ Meridian line measurements  
‚Ä¢ 2,200-year-old Dujiangyan irrigation system (still operational)  
‚Ä¢ Sericulture development ‚Ä¢ Magnetic declination discovery  

**Architectural Wonders**  
‚Ä¢ Great Wall - longest fortification  
‚Ä¢ Forbidden City - largest wooden complex  
‚Ä¢ Leshan Giant Buddha - monumental stone sculpture  
‚Ä¢ Yingxian Pagoda - oldest wooden pagoda  
‚Ä¢ Zhaozhou Bridge - pioneering stone arch design  

**Cultural Legacy**  
‚Ä¢ Oracle Bone Script (oldest continuous writing system)  
‚Ä¢ Twelve-tone temperament (1,800 years ahead of West)  
‚Ä¢ Zenghouyi Chimes (2,500-year-old perfected musical instruments)  
‚Ä¢ Yongle Encyclopedia - earliest encyclopedia  
‚Ä¢ Sun Tzu's Art of War - definitive military treatise  

Our ancestors built history's first million-population metropolis (Han Chang'an) and maintained global economic leadership for millennia. Even during its decline, Qing China accounted for 33% of world GDP. The Chinese intellectual tradition birthed civil service examinations, paper currency, and systematic historical records - concepts that shaped modern governance.

As inheritors of this unbroken 5,000-year civilization, we embody humanity's most enduring intellectual legacy. While transient powers rose and fell through conquest, China's sustainable development model - prioritizing agricultural stability and cultural continuity - demonstrates civilized wisdom. Our historical trajectory shows that true greatness lies not in territorial expansion, but in cultivating societal resilience and technological creativity.",PFNTHObSSKE

@pppp-q1g9u,1,"I am Chinese, a Chinese farmer. In ancient China, farmers held a much higher social status than merchants and artisans, second only to scholar-officials. This is because ancient China was the greatest agricultural civilization in human history, with agriculture as the foundation of its statecraft. The ideal of ancient Chinese rulers was: ""To ensure no one in the world suffers from hunger, let alone perish from starvation."" Yet it was precisely this greatest agricultural nation in ancient history that created the dazzling and magnificent Chinese civilization, which gave humanity countless inventions we still benefit from today: paper, gunpowder, compass, printing, football (cuju), anesthetics, imperial examination system, paper currency, binary system (originating from the I Ching 4,000 years ago), pi calculation that led the world for 1,000 years, and more.

China invented:
- The world's earliest astronomical instrument (Han Dynasty armillary sphere)
- The earliest seismoscope (Han Dynasty seismograph)
- The oldest surviving astronomical observatory (Dengfeng Star Observatory)
- The earliest calendar system (Ganzhi calendrical system)
- The earliest thermoscope (Western Han balance thermoscope)
- The earliest mechanical clock (invented by Zhang Heng)
- The earliest rocket technology (Song Dynasty ""Sky-piercing cannons"" - prototype of modern rockets)
- The earliest physics laboratory (acoustic resonance lab)
We were first to discover coal and petroleum, cultivate rice and millet, develop sericulture and silk weaving, utilize lacquer, record Halley's Comet, measure the meridian line, observe stellar motion, and discover magnetic declination.

In music, we established the twelve-tone temperament 1,800 years earlier than the West, and created the most sophisticated ancient musical instruments like the 2,500-year-old Zenghouyi Chimes. We produced humanity's first great circumnavigator - Zheng He. Our Chinese characters, invented 4,000 years ago, remain the world's oldest continuously used writing system and the sole non-alphabetic script.

China built:
- The largest wooden architectural complex (Forbidden City)
- The longest fortification (Great Wall)
- The highest palace (Potala Palace)
- The oldest functioning hydraulic project (Dujiangyan Irrigation System, 2,200 years old)
- The largest stone Buddha (Leshan Giant Buddha)
- The oldest wooden pagoda (Yingxian Wooden Pagoda)
- The earliest stone arch bridge (Zhaozhou Bridge)

For millennia, China boasted the world's largest cities: Chang'an (first metropolis with over 1 million population 2,000 years ago, vastly surpassing ancient Rome), Luoyang, Hangzhou, Kaifeng, Beijing, Yangzhou, and Chengdu. Economically, ancient China consistently led the world - even the declining Qing Dynasty accounted for one-third of global GDP at its peak.

China possesses the richest classical literary heritage, including:
- The earliest encyclopedia (Yongle Encyclopedia)
- First medical text (Yellow Emperor's Canon)
- Earliest poetry collection (Book of Songs)
- Most profound military treatise (Art of War)
- First dictionary (Erya)
- Earliest historical records (Book of Documents)
- First astronomical work (Gan Shi Star Catalog)
- Earliest architectural manual (Yingzao Fashi)
- First national pharmacopoeia (Tang Materia Medica)
- First detective novel (Cases of Judge Bao)
- Earliest newspaper (Court Gazette)

Chinese creations and wisdom have profoundly advanced human civilization. Modern Chinese are descendants of ancient farmers, officials, scholars, merchants, artisans, and emperors - inheritors of humanity's most sophisticated intellectual legacy. As the only unbroken ancient civilization that remains a global power today, China's peaceful nature embodies civilized wisdom, contrasting sharply with Western warmongering tendencies throughout history. Should Western powers persist in foolish trade wars or conflicts, history will repeat itself: transient powers may fade, while China endures as always.",PFNTHObSSKE

To put it in simpler terms. This will not lessen the price of eggs, infact, this will make protests over egg prices become an illegal, and criminal act.

@RuHo16,2,"Very sad about what happened, but I would like to say something I have witnessed in my college. This goes to all the professors who like to take it too far with their political views. A year ago, I took a Sociology class, and the professor was a freak democrat. Every class period, he would show us articles that talked bad about republicans, cops, the military, the US, etc. Basically, it was all propaganda and biased info, and hateful comments. As an immigrant who doesn‚Äôt care about politics much, I will say that that class was the most stressful class I have ever taken. Behind me was a guy who had just returned from the military. He was very quiet and would leave the class whenever the professor made hateful comments. I don‚Äôt think there was a time I wasn‚Äôt shaking. The guy probably was the best person in the world, but knowing that he had just returned from military service and probably had PTSD, and hearing about all these school shootings that were happening, I was terrified. One time, the professor showed us a video on how the military is trained and brainwashed, and the songs they sang during the training, and the guy behind me got up very quickly, not happy at all, and left. That night, I thought I was gonna die, but he did not come back, and later he dropped the class. So please, leave your political sh*t at home. Teach us the things that you are being paid to teach, not propaganda. This goes for both sides.",WC8FrOl6_G0

@addalittleenglish824,0,"Hey David, America finally waking up? Trump has been a Russian spy for about 38 years and counting. An ex-KGB chief: ‚ÄúIn 1987 I worked in‚Ä¶ the KGB of the USSR in Moscow‚Ä¶ our department recruited the 40 year-old businessman from the USA, Donald Trump, nicknamed ‚ÄòKrasnov‚Äô.‚Äù That‚Äôs when Trump starts buying full-page ads attacking NATO. ‚ÄúPutin is doing a great job of outsmarting our country.‚Äù He says. Steele report: Russian operatives gathered damaging video evidence of perverted sex acts of presidential candidate in 2013, for blackmail. Mueller said ‚ÄúThere were multiple, systematic efforts to interfere in our election.‚Äù Trump campaign had more than 140 contacts with Russian operatives, and Trump attempted to obstruct justice at least ten times. Campaign chair lied about then finally admitted to sharing info with Russian spy. Trump, ignoring US intelligence said: ‚Äú‚Ä¶Putin, he just said it wasn‚Äôt Russia. I will say this, I don‚Äôt see any reason why it would be.‚Äù Secret meeting in Trump Tower with Russkies. Jared attempts to set up secret back channel to Russia in the Russian embassy. Trump to NATO member on prospect of Russian attack on their country ‚ÄúIn fact, I would encourage them to do whatever the hell they want.‚Äù Trump: ‚ÄúIf Putin likes Donald Trump‚Ä¶ That‚Äôs called an asset‚Ä¶‚Äù Yeah, a Russian asset. FBI chief Kash Patel was paid $25,000 to appear in anti-FBI video by Russian backers. ‚ÄúThe love in the air, I‚Äôve never seen anything like it‚Äù Trump said of January 6 rioters, some of them cop-killers‚Ä¶ ‚ÄúRussia if you‚Äôre listening‚Ä¶‚Äù ‚ÄúI think you will probably be rewarded mightily‚Ä¶‚Äù Yes, they own a seditious, treasonous felonious American president. Where do you think all those top secret docs in the bathroom ended up? Anonymous says they have evidence the election was hacked for Trump, using Starlink... Whistleblower at NLRB says 15 minutes after DOGE got busy in NLRB, Russia tried to log in, with DOGE passwords, via Starlink...

Classifying groups that incite violence as 'homegrown terrorists' is a step toward safeguarding democracy. Racism and hate crimes, which contradict the principles of equality enshrined in the Declaration of Independence, must be unequivocally outlawed to ensure justice for all ethnicities.

@DavidBrown-uc4yv,0,"That‚Äôs not what ‚ÄúNavarro and others‚Äù said, claim; what they are claiming is that there other imposed barriers to entry above tariffs and those protections need to be removed as well. A flat Free Trade relationship will still produce a trade imbalance even as more US goods and services ship due to myriad factors different from trade factors, under the category Domestic Market Environments not the least of which is 350 million US consumers and a voracious mature consumer market developed since WWII. 

If Trump‚Äôs plan goes well, if he‚Äôs proven right, if Canada for example lowers barriers and Canadians begin to buy more and more American cars and farm tractors and Harley Davidsons they would only be doing so because their economy is heating up which means the US economy would also dynamically be heating as well, wouldn‚Äôt it. American consumers would be buying more Canadian products not the least of which is energy, correct. 

Point being, the trade imbalance surely will be reduced but it will remain. It won‚Äôt go away.

Instead China used their resultant enormous profits to build a huge military and to make weapons of war. Nixon's 1979 experiment has failed and it is now time to end it. IMO.,bk46yniQUto
@TrailerHitchRVCenter,1,"The United States adding tariffs is one thing. But galvanizing most of the world who have been cheated by China, is the checkmate move. I think it's important to consider that Trump spent his entire life negotiating and making deals. He then had the privilege to be the president for 4 years. He's been talking about tariffs for 30 years. This time around he is surrounded himself by some pretty high quality people. All of these facts make him such a great choice to fight for America. It's astounding to me that anyone would think that any politician, Democrat or Republican has remotely the same skill set as Trump in this very moment.",bk46yniQUto

@adorabledeplorble8497,30,"Ignacio Cruz-Mendoza was driving for Monique Trucking (and he was also not registered as a CDL holder in Mexico). He killed an off-duty truck driver (Scott Miller) and injured a handful of others, and at least one other injury was critical, yet Cruz-Mendoza was not injured. He left Cheyenne on June 11, not sure of his destination, and he did not know when his truck was last inspected (investigation showed it was four years prior). He was attempting to pass five vehicles in a 45mph zone (seven hours later) when he sideswiped them and caused a 14 hour road closure. He said his brakes went out, but there were skid marks at the scene and he was apparently not shifted into the right gear. He needed an interpreter in court. Somehow they listed everything as misdemeanor charges, gave him less than a year in jail, and even listed him as white in JeffCo jail. In July FMCSA declared his employer an imminent hazard to public safety after the leadership demonstrated a lack of knowledge of safety regulations (they had also had multiple violations within two years prior to this crash). Cruz-Mendoza had previously been pulled over in multiple states and also had at least one drug charge awhile back.

The number of failures in this entire story, including how any one station may breadcrumb the public by reporting on just a small piece of it, or how every agency involved may have done a crap ton more to ensure public safety, is all beyond insulting. That said, at least we are adding to his travels again and this actually did make the news. I am not an investigative reporter, but I was compelled to dig a little more on this last year. My only hope now is that our current administration can prevent him from returning again and that Scott Miller‚Äôs family and anyone else injured can now somehow find peace and healing. 

This story deserves more than 28 seconds of air time and a little bit of shock and awe over the number of deportations.",PMYGkC9Fiqo

@Roboto129,0,"Watched a documentary about the last months of WW2 where it mentioned Roosevelt and Churchill had to balance the difficulty of not prolonging the war while at the same time not incurring in avoidable casualties.  While, on the other hand, neither Hitler nor Stalin had such concerns.  The narrator explained the US and UK leaders understood they were at a disadvantage when looking at long term planning as they had to work with democracies.  That the population in democracies exercises a pressure on the government that is either suppressed or ignored by dictatorships.
Voted for Trump, but I do not see how we can compete in an area where the voice of the population is different in amount and degree.  In amount, because for us this is only politics, a side show to our daily occupations and distractions.  Each person is fed the narrative he choses to follow and believe.  In China, the state controls the media.  Their marketing campaign will place any difficulty seen by the people as an affront against their nation and will ensure everyone understands this is ‚Äúanother country‚Äôs (USA) fault‚Äù hence not their government.  In the degree, because here everyone will be crying when his dream car goes up 25% or he has to postpone buying a 60-inch flat screen he wanted for the next game.  While over there, shut, they will put up with food scarcity if they have to, as a token of national pride, because complaining is forbidden, because they see themselves as a nation rather than a group of individuals.  I mean, those that dare complain are just made disappear.  While here we go on TV screaming about how we cannot afford a vacation.
So, I would agree with the WW2 documentary that democracies cannot expect the same level of tolerance from their populations as dictatorships.  That concept would be timeless and pretty universal.",Xof9FwrCrsg
