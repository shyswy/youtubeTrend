@judgetk8327,0,Any person capable of such horrific actions has got some wires crossed up stairs that I don't believe can be fixed. The only problem I have with the ruling is the taxpayer is going to pay a lot of money to house and take care of this person day in and day out  where a bullet can save billions of dollars. When a country has the most prisons per capita  then there is seriously something wrong with the people and the system that taught this young man to act like this and have no remorse for his actions. The age should not play a role in it  and if it were brought to a vote  the parents would be in hot water as well.,5X5V59MHXNk

@bobl703,0,I remember a few years ago a couple teen girls carjacked an Uber driver (or maybe Lyft).  The driver was dragged by the seat belt  they hit a pole which slammed the door into the man  they kept driving and then rolled the car when they turned a corner at high speed.  The driver was killed and lay on the sidewalk.  The girls got out of the car and tried to run away  but one went back because she forgot her phone!!!!!!  When teens/kids do stuff like this  they are too far gone.  Life in prison is the only thing that will teach them that what they did was wrong.,5X5V59MHXNk

@yvonnes7412,1,Countries with less population may have money but they‚Äôre never going to need the quantities of goods that the 330 million Americans need‚Ä¶ so there‚Äôs always going to be a trade imbalance‚Ä¶ but the point is that the American people are the ones who benefit from trade because our country can‚Äôt produce all the goods in quantities to supply our massive population.

@pppp-q1g9u,2,As a Chinese farmer  I take immense pride in my ancestral heritage. In ancient China  we agriculturalists held esteemed social standing second only to scholar-officials  surpassing even merchants and artisans. This reflected our civilization's agricultural essence - China stood as humanity's greatest agrarian society  where statecraft fundamentally meant ensuring "no subject suffers hunger  let alone perishes from starvation." Remarkably  this farming-based civilization gifted mankind countless revolutionary innovations we still cherish:  **Technological Marvels**   ‚Ä¢ Papermaking  gunpowder  compass  and printing (Four Great Inventions)   ‚Ä¢ World's first armillary sphere (Han Dynasty astronomical instrument)   ‚Ä¢ Zhang Heng's seismoscope (132 AD earthquake detector)   ‚Ä¢ Earliest balance thermoscope (Western Han temperature measurement)   ‚Ä¢ Song Dynasty "Sky-piercing cannons" (rocket prototypes)   ‚Ä¢ 4 000-year-old binary system (from I Ching)   ‚Ä¢ Millennium-leading pi calculations    **Agricultural & Scientific Pioneering**   ‚Ä¢ First rice/millet cultivation ‚Ä¢ Initial coal/petroleum utilization   ‚Ä¢ World's earliest star catalog (Gan Shi) ‚Ä¢ Meridian line measurements   ‚Ä¢ 2 200-year-old Dujiangyan irrigation system (still operational)   ‚Ä¢ Sericulture development ‚Ä¢ Magnetic declination discovery    **Architectural Wonders**   ‚Ä¢ Great Wall - longest fortification   ‚Ä¢ Forbidden City - largest wooden complex   ‚Ä¢ Leshan Giant Buddha - monumental stone sculpture   ‚Ä¢ Yingxian Pagoda - oldest wooden pagoda   ‚Ä¢ Zhaozhou Bridge - pioneering stone arch design    **Cultural Legacy**   ‚Ä¢ Oracle Bone Script (oldest continuous writing system)   ‚Ä¢ Twelve-tone temperament (1 800 years ahead of West)   ‚Ä¢ Zenghouyi Chimes (2 500-year-old perfected musical instruments)   ‚Ä¢ Yongle Encyclopedia - earliest encyclopedia   ‚Ä¢ Sun Tzu's Art of War - definitive military treatise    Our ancestors built history's first million-population metropolis (Han Chang'an) and maintained global economic leadership for millennia. Even during its decline  Qing China accounted for 33% of world GDP. The Chinese intellectual tradition birthed civil service examinations  paper currency  and systematic historical records - concepts that shaped modern governance.  As inheritors of this unbroken 5 000-year civilization  we embody humanity's most enduring intellectual legacy. While transient powers rose and fell through conquest  China's sustainable development model - prioritizing agricultural stability and cultural continuity - demonstrates civilized wisdom. Our historical trajectory shows that true greatness lies not in territorial expansion  but in cultivating societal resilience and technological creativity.,PFNTHObSSKE

@pppp-q1g9u,1,I am Chinese  a Chinese farmer. In ancient China  farmers held a much higher social status than merchants and artisans  second only to scholar-officials. This is because ancient China was the greatest agricultural civilization in human history  with agriculture as the foundation of its statecraft. The ideal of ancient Chinese rulers was: "To ensure no one in the world suffers from hunger  let alone perish from starvation." Yet it was precisely this greatest agricultural nation in ancient history that created the dazzling and magnificent Chinese civilization  which gave humanity countless inventions we still benefit from today: paper  gunpowder  compass  printing  football (cuju)  anesthetics  imperial examination system  paper currency  binary system (originating from the I Ching 4 000 years ago)  pi calculation that led the world for 1 000 years  and more.  China invented: - The world's earliest astronomical instrument (Han Dynasty armillary sphere) - The earliest seismoscope (Han Dynasty seismograph) - The oldest surviving astronomical observatory (Dengfeng Star Observatory) - The earliest calendar system (Ganzhi calendrical system) - The earliest thermoscope (Western Han balance thermoscope) - The earliest mechanical clock (invented by Zhang Heng) - The earliest rocket technology (Song Dynasty "Sky-piercing cannons" - prototype of modern rockets) - The earliest physics laboratory (acoustic resonance lab) We were first to discover coal and petroleum  cultivate rice and millet  develop sericulture and silk weaving  utilize lacquer  record Halley's Comet  measure the meridian line  observe stellar motion  and discover magnetic declination.  In music  we established the twelve-tone temperament 1 800 years earlier than the West  and created the most sophisticated ancient musical instruments like the 2 500-year-old Zenghouyi Chimes. We produced humanity's first great circumnavigator - Zheng He. Our Chinese characters  invented 4 000 years ago  remain the world's oldest continuously used writing system and the sole non-alphabetic script.  China built: - The largest wooden architectural complex (Forbidden City) - The longest fortification (Great Wall) - The highest palace (Potala Palace) - The oldest functioning hydraulic project (Dujiangyan Irrigation System  2 200 years old) - The largest stone Buddha (Leshan Giant Buddha) - The oldest wooden pagoda (Yingxian Wooden Pagoda) - The earliest stone arch bridge (Zhaozhou Bridge)  For millennia  China boasted the world's largest cities: Chang'an (first metropolis with over 1 million population 2 000 years ago  vastly surpassing ancient Rome)  Luoyang  Hangzhou  Kaifeng  Beijing  Yangzhou  and Chengdu. Economically  ancient China consistently led the world - even the declining Qing Dynasty accounted for one-third of global GDP at its peak.  China possesses the richest classical literary heritage  including: - The earliest encyclopedia (Yongle Encyclopedia) - First medical text (Yellow Emperor's Canon) - Earliest poetry collection (Book of Songs) - Most profound military treatise (Art of War) - First dictionary (Erya) - Earliest historical records (Book of Documents) - First astronomical work (Gan Shi Star Catalog) - Earliest architectural manual (Yingzao Fashi) - First national pharmacopoeia (Tang Materia Medica) - First detective novel (Cases of Judge Bao) - Earliest newspaper (Court Gazette)  Chinese creations and wisdom have profoundly advanced human civilization. Modern Chinese are descendants of ancient farmers  officials  scholars  merchants  artisans  and emperors - inheritors of humanity's most sophisticated intellectual legacy. As the only unbroken ancient civilization that remains a global power today  China's peaceful nature embodies civilized wisdom  contrasting sharply with Western warmongering tendencies throughout history. Should Western powers persist in foolish trade wars or conflicts  history will repeat itself: transient powers may fade  while China endures as always.,PFNTHObSSKE

@BSage-bo1gt,2,Young man  I am not versed in computers nor weather. So the question I am asking might seem silly  but can you direct your Ibot just to answer a person's request for a certain area or town? This would elimate people in the chat room asking about their area online. This would allow you to still focus on the important areas and releave stress of those that your weather doesn't affect. Like i said  Ryan  I don't know the big picture  and this is only a suggestion. Thank you for what you and your team sacrifice for us.,V49VDgGopks

@minecraftsteve2504,0,So GLAD to see so many people  my neighbors  my fellow americans  be so happy and grateful to allow blatant disregard and lack of care to our CONSTITUTION  be upheld in our own government.   Those of you who support conservatism  should be ashamed. For this is no longer about tradition  but about survival. We're in a turning point in history  the man you call president is becoming a tyrant  who's administration cares not for your freedoms.  To put it in simpler terms. This will not lessen the price of eggs  infact  this will make protests over egg prices become an illegal  and criminal act.  To my fellow americans who follow trump  wake up. Or else you may find yourself in el salvador  as one of the "home grown criminals" that trump has stated he will send to El Salvador.  Wake up.,yTr4Eo90RMw

@Robert_Keel,2,If they are not unkind  selfish or thoughtless - why did they vote for Trump?  He told all of us what he wanted and what he was going to do. All he wanted was your vote  so he peppered his rhetoric with things like "I'll will stop the war in Ukraine in one day" and "I'll lower the cost of eggs on day one". Now  he is sweeping up American citizens up off the street  without warrants and holding them in jail. He has single handedly started a trade war that has resulted in a loss of trust in the US by our closest allies  who have turned away. What were they thinking - or did they just drink the kool aid  hoping for the best and not giving a thought about what was to come?,Wsn1baT3WaU

This man would burn your house down if it brought in more money for the bank he would take your grandma's pension if he could.

@johnshite4656,0,I bet Trump has been at Powell's throat since January  and that now we just happen to finally be hearing about it. Trump will fire him and install a dove to end QT and return QE. When the firing happens initially there will be a big crash  but it will be short. Soon a replacement will be announced and then sentiment will get greedy again. We'll see another pump n dump in the markets  possibly a big one. When inflation comes back strong and the economy tanks the markets will resume their nosedive. This I prophesize. I expected something like this ever since Trump was elected back in NOV. The "cause" will be that markets are down  and it will be enough.,2GgRnPO4i60

@RuHo16,2,Very sad about what happened  but I would like to say something I have witnessed in my college. This goes to all the professors who like to take it too far with their political views. A year ago  I took a Sociology class  and the professor was a freak democrat. Every class period  he would show us articles that talked bad about republicans  cops  the military  the US  etc. Basically  it was all propaganda and biased info  and hateful comments. As an immigrant who doesn‚Äôt care about politics much  I will say that that class was the most stressful class I have ever taken. Behind me was a guy who had just returned from the military. He was very quiet and would leave the class whenever the professor made hateful comments. I don‚Äôt think there was a time I wasn‚Äôt shaking. The guy probably was the best person in the world  but knowing that he had just returned from military service and probably had PTSD  and hearing about all these school shootings that were happening  I was terrified. One time  the professor showed us a video on how the military is trained and brainwashed  and the songs they sang during the training  and the guy behind me got up very quickly  not happy at all  and left. That night  I thought I was gonna die  but he did not come back  and later he dropped the class. So please  leave your political sh*t at home. Teach us the things that you are being paid to teach  not propaganda. This goes for both sides.,WC8FrOl6_G0

@RobertMeyers-t7r,0,üòÆ  Ann you obviously don‚Äôt know how the US is set up. I can‚Äôt speak for the Cherokee however the Choctaw Nation‚Äôs reservation covers a lot of Oklahoma  google it. Once accepted into the tribe members of the tribe have dual citizenship. Their US citizenship and their Choctaw citizenship. The Choctaw are the third largest native tribe in the US. My family‚Äôs surname is Durant. Two US cities on the current US map have connections back to my family. Durant  Mississippi was named after Captain Louis Durant and Durant  Oklahoma was founded by Dixon Durant  my 2X great grandfather. Much of the tribe are spread across the US and the Indian citizenship law in 1921 gives us the right to be here. The matriarchal side of my family has been here for hundreds of years before Columbus ever discovered he was lost because he was actually looking for a new trading route to Japan  China  and the Spice Islands. The fact is I and my family voted for Trump all three times and I pay US taxes and work two jobs here in the US using my US citizenship as validation of my right to do so and so does my extended family members. Now tell me to go back where I come from and if you‚Äôre in Oklahoma or Mississippi might find my tepee erected in your yard. üòÇ Chief William Durant was a politician in the Oklahoma Legislature  was instrumental in founding South Eastern Oklahoma University  and was the cousin of Dickson Durant my 2X great grandfather.

@addalittleenglish824,0,Hey David  America finally waking up? Trump has been a Russian spy for about 38 years and counting. An ex-KGB chief: ‚ÄúIn 1987 I worked in‚Ä¶ the KGB of the USSR in Moscow‚Ä¶ our department recruited the 40 year-old businessman from the USA  Donald Trump  nicknamed ‚ÄòKrasnov‚Äô.‚Äù That‚Äôs when Trump starts buying full-page ads attacking NATO. ‚ÄúPutin is doing a great job of outsmarting our country.‚Äù He says. Steele report: Russian operatives gathered damaging video evidence of perverted sex acts of presidential candidate in 2013  for blackmail. Mueller said ‚ÄúThere were multiple  systematic efforts to interfere in our election.‚Äù Trump campaign had more than 140 contacts with Russian operatives  and Trump attempted to obstruct justice at least ten times. Campaign chair lied about then finally admitted to sharing info with Russian spy. Trump  ignoring US intelligence said: ‚Äú‚Ä¶Putin  he just said it wasn‚Äôt Russia. I will say this  I don‚Äôt see any reason why it would be.‚Äù Secret meeting in Trump Tower with Russkies. Jared attempts to set up secret back channel to Russia in the Russian embassy. Trump to NATO member on prospect of Russian attack on their country ‚ÄúIn fact  I would encourage them to do whatever the hell they want.‚Äù Trump: ‚ÄúIf Putin likes Donald Trump‚Ä¶ That‚Äôs called an asset‚Ä¶‚Äù Yeah  a Russian asset. FBI chief Kash Patel was paid $25 000 to appear in anti-FBI video by Russian backers. ‚ÄúThe love in the air  I‚Äôve never seen anything like it‚Äù Trump said of January 6 rioters  some of them cop-killers‚Ä¶ ‚ÄúRussia if you‚Äôre listening‚Ä¶‚Äù ‚ÄúI think you will probably be rewarded mightily‚Ä¶‚Äù Yes  they own a seditious  treasonous felonious American president. Where do you think all those top secret docs in the bathroom ended up? Anonymous says they have evidence the election was hacked for Trump  using Starlink... Whistleblower at NLRB says 15 minutes after DOGE got busy in NLRB  Russia tried to log in  with DOGE passwords  via Starlink... Even before whistleblower filed complaint  he was threatened  along with drone footage of himself... All allegedly‚Ä¶,CVb4DkrEhmA

@xaviercham,0,Coming from a couple of highly educated people  I have to say that they're deliberately misleading. The analogy used in the first minute is already incorrect as countries are neither customers nor merchants  they are both. A customers pays for a product with their salary. A country does not have a salary  it relies on trade to receive income. When a trade is imbalanced  the country bleeds and becomes poorer. Trade imbalances are caused by government policy and can only be combated with government policy. For example  you sell oranges and need apples  and I sell apples and need oranges. If I choose to sell apples to you but produce my own oranges  you will become broke over time. As a result  you'll charge me a tariff to sell my apples to you so that you break even. This is pretty simple  no?,gNson4TqUO4

The immunity granted to individuals in positions of power should never shield them from facing justice for alleged crimes  including the 34 counts against Donald Trump. The Capitol Hill attack  a stark reminder of the dangers of extremism  underscores the need to address domestic threats with urgency and fairness. Classifying groups that incite violence as 'homegrown terrorists' is a step toward safeguarding democracy. Racism and hate crimes  which contradict the principles of equality enshrined in the Declaration of Independence  must be unequivocally outlawed to ensure justice for all ethnicities. Fiscal responsibility is equally vital; spending beyond our means jeopardizes the nation's future.

Drill baby drill dont work  because you cant use the oil you drill.. you are dependent on imports for your car  Kennedy.. 2. Trade deficits are neither good or bad. The entire premise for this dispute is false. That US has a trade defit  just means you are more wealthy than other countries and can afford to buy the cheaper products from abroad. Also 3. You have a hot job market.. who will sit at a sewing machine for 3 USD pr hour to create the Nike shoes you buy? 4. Cutting the federal gov. Employees; consider they are 2.5 mill (except Military)  but local and state public servants are 25 mill.. and add  that 50 years ago you also had 2.5 mill in federal Gov employees.. now still 2.5 mill but with 100 mill people more.. thats normally considered efficient.  Again  if you understand anything about trade deficits  you will know it does not matter.. you have as an individual a trade deficit with the grocery in which you buy your goods.. its simple and plain. You Americans are being seriously manipulated. Think! Please start to think! If you dont  you will burn from the inside.,A6q8hf7e1iY
@DavidBrown-uc4yv,0,That‚Äôs not what ‚ÄúNavarro and others‚Äù said  claim; what they are claiming is that there other imposed barriers to entry above tariffs and those protections need to be removed as well. A flat Free Trade relationship will still produce a trade imbalance even as more US goods and services ship due to myriad factors different from trade factors  under the category Domestic Market Environments not the least of which is 350 million US consumers and a voracious mature consumer market developed since WWII.   If Trump‚Äôs plan goes well  if he‚Äôs proven right  if Canada for example lowers barriers and Canadians begin to buy more and more American cars and farm tractors and Harley Davidsons they would only be doing so because their economy is heating up which means the US economy would also dynamically be heating as well  wouldn‚Äôt it. American consumers would be buying more Canadian products not the least of which is energy  correct.   Point being  the trade imbalance surely will be reduced but it will remain. It won‚Äôt go away. Which is fine ‚Äî it‚Äôs not about eyeballing a factor like staring at a gauge  it‚Äôs about mutual economic growth and dynamic activity in and between both nations. It‚Äôs about transactions in its most simple terms.,A6q8hf7e1iY

@adorabledeplorble8497,30,Ignacio Cruz-Mendoza was driving for Monique Trucking (and he was also not registered as a CDL holder in Mexico). He killed an off-duty truck driver (Scott Miller) and injured a handful of others  and at least one other injury was critical  yet Cruz-Mendoza was not injured. He left Cheyenne on June 11  not sure of his destination  and he did not know when his truck was last inspected (investigation showed it was four years prior). He was attempting to pass five vehicles in a 45mph zone (seven hours later) when he sideswiped them and caused a 14 hour road closure. He said his brakes went out  but there were skid marks at the scene and he was apparently not shifted into the right gear. He needed an interpreter in court. Somehow they listed everything as misdemeanor charges  gave him less than a year in jail  and even listed him as white in JeffCo jail. In July FMCSA declared his employer an imminent hazard to public safety after the leadership demonstrated a lack of knowledge of safety regulations (they had also had multiple violations within two years prior to this crash). Cruz-Mendoza had previously been pulled over in multiple states and also had at least one drug charge awhile back.  The number of failures in this entire story  including how any one station may breadcrumb the public by reporting on just a small piece of it  or how every agency involved may have done a crap ton more to ensure public safety  is all beyond insulting. That said  at least we are adding to his travels again and this actually did make the news. I am not an investigative reporter  but I was compelled to dig a little more on this last year. My only hope now is that our current administration can prevent him from returning again and that Scott Miller‚Äôs family and anyone else injured can now somehow find peace and healing.   This story deserves more than 28 seconds of air time and a little bit of shock and awe over the number of deportations.,PMYGkC9Fiqo

@zitherzon2121,1,President Nixon's greatest mistake was not Watergate or even the Viet Nam war. It was in 1979 opening the West to trade with China in a mistaken belief that the evil communist government there would eventually be convinced to join the USA and the world in fair trade and friendship.  Instead China used their resultant enormous profits to build a huge military and to make weapons of war. Nixon's 1979 experiment has failed and it is now time to end it. IMO.,bk46yniQUto
@TrailerHitchRVCenter,1,The United States adding tariffs is one thing. But galvanizing most of the world who have been cheated by China  is the checkmate move. I think it's important to consider that Trump spent his entire life negotiating and making deals. He then had the privilege to be the president for 4 years. He's been talking about tariffs for 30 years. This time around he is surrounded himself by some pretty high quality people. All of these facts make him such a great choice to fight for America. It's astounding to me that anyone would think that any politician  Democrat or Republican has remotely the same skill set as Trump in this very moment.,bk46yniQUto

The truth is  BOTH parties are criminal organizations controlled by fascist "elites" who care nothing at all for the people. The U.S. is NOT a democracy or republic  but ruled by an oligarchy (Princeton study 2014).

@Roboto129,0,Watched a documentary about the last months of WW2 where it mentioned Roosevelt and Churchill had to balance the difficulty of not prolonging the war while at the same time not incurring in avoidable casualties.  While  on the other hand  neither Hitler nor Stalin had such concerns.  The narrator explained the US and UK leaders understood they were at a disadvantage when looking at long term planning as they had to work with democracies.  That the population in democracies exercises a pressure on the government that is either suppressed or ignored by dictatorships. Voted for Trump  but I do not see how we can compete in an area where the voice of the population is different in amount and degree.  In amount  because for us this is only politics  a side show to our daily occupations and distractions.  Each person is fed the narrative he choses to follow and believe.  In China  the state controls the media.  Their marketing campaign will place any difficulty seen by the people as an affront against their nation and will ensure everyone understands this is ‚Äúanother country‚Äôs (USA) fault‚Äù hence not their government.  In the degree  because here everyone will be crying when his dream car goes up 25% or he has to postpone buying a 60-inch flat screen he wanted for the next game.  While over there  shut  they will put up with food scarcity if they have to  as a token of national pride  because complaining is forbidden  because they see themselves as a nation rather than a group of individuals.  I mean  those that dare complain are just made disappear.  While here we go on TV screaming about how we cannot afford a vacation. So  I would agree with the WW2 documentary that democracies cannot expect the same level of tolerance from their populations as dictatorships.  That concept would be timeless and pretty universal.,Xof9FwrCrsg

@robertdadabo9076,2,That video always had me wondering  because a girl her age wouldn't come out and say Hello  my name's Ava  I'm a Scorpio... What kid her age adds that they're a Scorpio? I'll tell you who says that kind of stuff  working girls do! No  I don't know from experience  but if you watch enough TV  you can kinda figure it out for yourselves. That's something that a young girl  being trained on what to say to men  would talk like to her clients if she was working them. That poor girl  I can just imagine what she  and all the other unfortunate girls  have been through. Something else that hasn't been brought up  is the fact that she might have been used as someone that lures the younger girls in  by trying to make them feel safe  and luring them in to the lions den.,LzFXAVsDMCU
@Fun.Guy.Forager,2,19:43 so the pizza gate keeping kids in tunnels is true given what Diddy was doing in New York. I dont see people apologizing to the people who exposed it but made fun of as a hoax.,LzFXAVsDMCU
@JamesJordan-rf4zm,1,Combs was always a creep  going back to the 1991 rap concert stampede at City College where 9 people were killed. He's a punk from Mt. Vernon who Denzel Washington exposed decades ago. He is going to rat everyone out from jail to save his punk ass..üòÆ,LzFXAVsDMCU
