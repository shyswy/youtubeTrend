@shuko_0,1,"mia flinching at the smell of the snickers cookie is so real LOL, ""smells like death"" is also one of my catchphrases as a peanut allergy sufferer",bxlzbJPvwK8
@marielinderholm5767,1,"Actually they weren't wrong, peanuts are not a nut. They are the worst name though because so many people assume they are a nut because of the name. Almonds are not a nut either. So if you are allergic to nuts you can eat peanuts and almonds. If you are allergic to all of them you might need to be more explicit about it in restaurants and similar places 😊",bxlzbJPvwK8

@Quickeeeee,1,"Sweets really is the case of: you want it when you can't have (much of) it. When I was a student I bought sweets all the time to keep up... And after I graduated I didn't buy sweets for like two years. It just lost its appeal. And I still, many years later, don't like things that are just sweet; I only want things that have a strong flavor of something else like coco or lemon.
And yeh I know sugar addiction is real, but I guess for me the association between sugar and studying was so strong and off-putting that I just didn't fall for the addiction.",bxlzbJPvwK8

@EdmurPortuga,0,"The documentary State Organs was screened in Tokyo on March 26, 2025. Canadian human rights lawyer David Matas gave a lecture at the event as part of the effort to raise awareness of the Chinese Communist Party’s (CCP) forced organ harvesting of prisoners of conscience. The screening of State Organs aims to expose the human rights violations in China, increase public attention to the issue of forced organ harvesting, and promote cooperation within the international community to help bring an end to the atrocity and protect people’s lives and dignity.

The film took about seven years to produce and documents the CCP’s forced organ harvesting from Falun Gong practitioners, who have been violently persecuted by the CCP since 1999. The film, which includes eyewitness accounts, opens with the shocking testimony of former surgeon Mr. Zheng Zhi, who witnessed the live organ harvesting. In addition, the film features recordings of overseas human rights activists who posed as patients and called Chinese hospitals to inquire about the speed of organ transplants and whether the organs came from Falun Gong practitioners.

The documentary also depicts the pain of the families of missing Falun Gong practitioners: a father tries every means possible to save his son; a brother mentally prepares himself to face the news of his brother’s death. The audience was deeply moved by these stories.

State Organs director Zhang Yongjin explained that forced organ harvesting is just one facet of the CCP’s genocidal campaign against Falun Gong. He said that as long as the totalitarian regime continues, human rights violations will be covered up and the number of victims will continue to increase.",bxlzbJPvwK8

I can tell you have a beautiful soul and the energy you give off in your videos is so warm and genuine😊. anyways I just wanted to tell you those things in case no one has yet because you deserve to hear it🫶🏼 keep up the amazing content girly💗🙂‍↕️!,IDG3Lw44g_w

@zoelouise140,4,I think what helps get out of the everyday is the same feeling is learning something new feeling uncomfortable and frustrated as you try to adapt to something new. The sameness feeling to me is feeling uncomfortably comfortable. So something as frustrating as sewing was probably a good choice of new hobby and it’s something you can continue to learn with as you learn to make new stuff,HLC4bms6bsA
@tammyferrer9946,3,"Finding the right antidepressant can be really hard. If the side effects were affecting your life then you definitely made the right decision to come off that one. When you find the right medication, the side effects will be minimal or completely absent and the benefits should outweigh them. Also, just keep in mind that these type of medications do not cure the chemical imbalance but rather treats it, so once you do find the right one and feel better, its the medication working. It sounds like you are experiencing a withdrawal from the lexapro which is very common and although difficult in the moment, it truly is only temporary. You are so brave for not only taking the leap to treat your anxiety but also deciding to come off of your medication and just try to be kind to yourself especially during this process 💝 remember to keep attending follow up appointments with your doctor/psychiatrist. You’re gonna get through this and finding a hobby will really help!",HLC4bms6bsA
@mieowpill,3,"tbh there are a lot of comments talking about ssri withdrawals and how it will be worth it, but if you continue to feel like then it might be worth considering going back on it.  my sister is almost 30 and she has been on SSRIs for over 13 years now, and i think thats completely fine too. when i got off SSRIs i felt like i wasnt in control of my life for a whole year until i did CBT, which really helped me. but generally CBT is used in conjunction with SSRIs so maybe it would be helpful to go to therapy :)",HLC4bms6bsA
@canadianprincess478,2,"Mandy!! I have been on Lexapro for almost 3 years and I decided to try getting off of it like a month ago. I went down to half my dose and I have felt very anxious and strange since I started this. For me, I’m just going to try to push through until I can get fully off of it and wait a couple months to see if I feel normal again without all the anxiety. AND omg I also just bought a sewing machine like a week after I started taking less Lexapro bc I was going crazy 😭. Since then I have been busy and haven’t been able to get to sewing yet, but I’m excited and hope it is going well for you. Also I completely agree with the “feeling like I need a purpose” thing and I personally believe that all of these thoughts could be caused by/boosted by the lack of dopamine due to being off of Lexapro. It’s so crazy how our experiences are lining up rn and I wish the best for you!!",HLC4bms6bsA
@jessicajadestories,2,I totally relate to feeling like you always want more in life - I think part of it is just being in ur 20s and realising life is actually low key boring. The point isn't to experience joy 100% of the time but to always strive for contentment. We literally just have to fill our time here with whatever feels right at the time. Thank you for being open in your videos Mandy it makes them even more comforting!,HLC4bms6bsA
@TahliaMiller-k9c,2,"hi Mandy! I absolutely love your vlogs and I'm also a beginner at sewing, I have a few tips that helped me a lot with sewing, I used Tik Tok and YouTube for tutorials on how to use the different functions of the machine and just how to use it in general but def make sure to type in your model type and brand to get a more defined search for you and I def recommend finding patterns for clothing designs and also definitely getting a measuring tape to find your measurements so you have a nicer fit to the clothes you make, love you lots!",HLC4bms6bsA

Its completely normal to have to try different meds out to see what work for you and, in my experience, going on lexapro alleviated almost all my overthinking and worries but that ismt everyone’s experience and maybe asking your provider about other medications would help you out!!  love the channel and how honest you are it really makes me feel seen! ❤❤❤",HLC4bms6bsA

Ik i feel similar to this when i'm close to my period, but also sometimes it just comes randomly. but it will always pass and maybe come back but if it does just remember it wont last forever like its natural for us to feel this way. rambling asf rn but yeah there my two cents",HLC4bms6bsA

But you’re teaching yourself trades and executing them at a high level.  It’s inspiring to watch.  I remind myself now when I embark on a large, detail intensive project, that I can do this.  Just slow it down, focus, do one step at a time and eventually the completion will arrive.

@thenesthomestead,2,My wife and I are curious how you identify male and female plant varieties? We are newer in our homesteading journey and doing our best to learn every day <3 - Dakota & Angela,l5EBlpXgEpY

@GarLic-g2f,1,Congratulations on growing your family! 🎉,l5EBlpXgEpY
@rockyhighwayroad7365,1,I have heard about the seeds not being true to the plant if grafting was involved but are you sure about the cuttings also being different? Cuttings are generally clones of the parent plant,l5EBlpXgEpY
@Milen983,1,"I remember my grandpa had grafted an extremely delicious plum that I have tried only several times from the stores in my home country Armenia. They were rare variety, and I haven’t found them in any other store, those I found several times were very close but not exactly those. My point is, those grafted branches dried easily when after a while we weren’t able to regularly water that part of the garden. While the wild branches from the same tree continued to grow robustly. So we lost those nice grafted trees. Grafted trees are good but my impression is they are more fragile than the wild or seed grown ones.",l5EBlpXgEpY
@redneckswag616inhd6,1,"Hey from Louisiana, my grandfather has grown muscadines for 30ish years.

Some varieties get bigger than a golf ball and are addictively delicious, a muscadine will only produce fruit if a male is present.  One male muscadine will pollinate 2-3 female vines.

His favorites are the three following varieties, Black Beauty (female), Carlos (Bronze male), and Darlene (Bronze female).

He orders his vines from I-S-O-N-S (without dashes), because they ship bare root, and still take phone orders from a catalog lol.

My family loves them, and I'm confident you will too.",l5EBlpXgEpY

@Justin.740,0,Love how you explained your methods of efficiency it really sounds like how I do things myself 😂,l5EBlpXgEpY
@WimsMill,0,"Peaches are one of the more exceptional fruit types. They are often quite close to the parent when planted from seed. Peach trees don't really grow really big so no need to put it on dwarfing rootstock. Also Peach has a problem with postponed incompatibility when grafting on plum. They tend to be more prone to catch diseases en grow slower. The best performing peach trees are the ones grown from seed. If you really want a specific peach variety, graft that one on a peach seedling.",l5EBlpXgEpY
@marcus3457,0,"This was fascinating, thank you Anne.  I am curious, do you happen to have a video on making your own grafting paste?  I tried searching and it did not come up, but perhaps it is part of a video without those exact words in it?  If not, and if it isn't too much trouble, is that something you wouldn't mind making?

Thank you so much, and Happy Easter!",l5EBlpXgEpY

This year we plan to put in fruit trees and berry bushes, but I am really hoping for a new raised garden bed for the summer after next.

It’s a tough job, and I honestly don’t have much time since my wife and I have a baby on the way and I have to get the house ready for children.

@bobbieleesherry185,9,"Lisa, you say that when you have nuts in your pantry they tend to go bad. You know the nutrition nuts can add to your dishes so buy what ever nuts your family likes and keep them in your freezer. Purchase them in bulk with the least amount of processing and when needed use them whole or chopped as desired. We used English walnuts primarily and my job was to just break them up using my fingers, twisting them between my thumb and forefinger. It seems to eliminate the dust created by chopping with a knife. 

I’m a single senior that still works full time but I enjoy watching you and thinking of how much I could have used your ideas 50 years ago.",rAKogFVjs4Y

And also… I now take bacon while it’s partially thawed and cut it in small pieces with my butcher knife and then cook it in skillet.

@Jraywhatsyourname,3,"I don’t think I’ve ever commented. I’ve watched since I was 12 y/o and I’m now 26 and a homeowner!  Your home has always been a MAJOR inspiration for me and set the standard for the style of homes I love to this day, so I’m lovvvving the new camera so I can see all the little details or your beautiful home in the background.  I also think it leaves more room to see hand gestures/ people you are interacting with which is so nice! Also crazy how clear the image is, it’s a little intense at first because I feel like you guys are in my living room 😂",GjrVrutODsI

@gigi_7770,8,"🙋🏻‍♀️ Petition for a Q&A with both you and Romeo in it where we get to ask both of you guys questions. I think that would be cool to get to know Romeo a little more and we can also ask him his opinion on what he thinks about your renovations because I’m sure he’s very proud! P.S. you are doing so great Macenna, we are all so proud of you and how far you have come. I know this bathroom is going to look amazing! ❤",vC_HDYun7yo

@theresawilson7386,5,"Macenna, you were challenged at the cottage with so many jobs! The windows, the cabinets, matching the stain, etc. Like a trooper, you did it! I'm sorry, i would still be stomping my feet and be so frustrated with the placement of that bath drain! You are amazing!💜💜💜",vC_HDYun7yo
@lisakendrick1410,4,"I vote for closing the upper section of the laundry area in for stuff like Christmas storage. Closed storage is always beneficial. Laundry rooms or areas can be dusty so closed storage is good. I also vote for doors to the laundry area for both noise insulation and the lint that can float around a laundry room, no matter how much you clean.   The cottage is looking so beautiful!",vC_HDYun7yo

@Pernilla_Nilsson,2,"I absolutely LOVE this series! 
I don’t know if MaCenna posted a floor plan of the cottage in one of the previous videos, but I would love to see one!

@theresaevans7523,2,An antique hutch top above the Landry room would look good.,vC_HDYun7yo
@AnUntitledAdventure,1,"Design-wise I'm unsure exactly how it would play out, but I think lowering the ceiling in the laundry space but using that height that you lowered from as storage would be super beneficial! Whether it's closed cabinetry, open boxes with curtains (like a skirt style around a sink base), or sliding doors or something different! You could still do the curtains or bifold doors below to tuck away the laundry, but it would allow you to gain some extra storage space for those items that you don't need regularly! Another fun option could be building out an entire ""built-in"" looking cabinet system that sort of frames out the laundry machines and could offer even more flexible and custom storage!",vC_HDYun7yo
@ranoomsh1464,1,I think you should consider finding a scrap piece from like a countertop marble for the shower step. i am not sure if it'll be less expensive but it will be the size you need,vC_HDYun7yo
@maricelofarrell2572,1,How about a barn door for the laundry?,vC_HDYun7yo
@nicolesoliven276,1,Just want to say you are amazing. I don’t doubt that the work is grueling and there’s so many decisions that affect other decisions. I’m sure your mind but be swirling with so many ideas. Thank you for taking time to keep us in the loop and being an inspiration to stay positive even when things are tough!,vC_HDYun7yo
@karmaremusic,1,Laundry room needs a doooooorr! It’s noisy! The door will block it out. Maybe do French doors with curtains ON them,vC_HDYun7yo

@ansleycharlton1597,1,Charleston is amazing! I live 2 hours away and try to go as much as I can with my dog. Charleston doesn’t have an actual beach but Isle of Palms is my fav beach around there.
