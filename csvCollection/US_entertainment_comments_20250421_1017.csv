@TheMike91393,0,Learning how to swim should be part of Phys. Ed.  change my mind. It was for one High School I went to but not the other. So many stories every year of people drowning because they don't know how to swim. One really sad story I remember from a few years ago was a cop  who didn't know how to swim  drowned while trying to save a kid who didn't know how to swim. The kid also drowned.,R-kz3deX1uU
@syhop40,0,...ans thats bc of access and culture.,R-kz3deX1uU
@jdotsalter910,0,I'm black and i can swim.  My theory is that historically white kids take swim lessons which cost money which blacks didn't have for a recreational activity.  Then it just became engrained that swimming was something the white people did and not blacks  like skiing.    But more and more are taking swim lessons now  like more and more are skiing.  I'm learning how to ski in my 40s because skiing was just not something my family did or anyone i knew growing up.  We didn't even think about it(but i did take swim lessons). I think swimming is similar in this regard.  Look at Simone Manuel and Cullen Jones  black American Olympians.,R-kz3deX1uU

@delgaines828,3,I grew up southern from El Centro to d/fw to San Diego to Brunswick Ga and back and forth then finally Miami now back to So Cal . Roots in Texas   and I was NEVER raised or witnessed racism from my family tho grandma talked of colored farm and ranch workers of HER parents   always with respect and etiquette.  My father would lay the gun belt across my ass if I ever acted differently or spoke ugly   period .     There is great pride of southern respect and love that is genuine and not only disregarded but many a black southern gentleman discredited for his values   morals and gentile' obligations   responsibilities duty and honor .     It's complicated and should be respected as such .    Just my feeling as I've grown old and seen and learned and been wrong   a lot .     Thank you for sharing the name of this series .     Can't even slight the Ticketmaster as cultural expectations to act a certain way could cost him his job . Just a f'd up world to be a human in . Politics . Uhg and yuk . But the Lord will take me one day . Thank you Jesus .,cw6EmhnQXTM
