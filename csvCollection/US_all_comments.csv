@justleeguy9195,1,Yet another 20GB to add to the already bloated file size  yet another slew of bugs and optimisation issues to deal with.   Quite frankly I couldn't care less for these events any more  not when even a fairly high end PC is completely unable to even launch the game because Epicgames will completely ignore any and all issues  instead favouring cheap  flashy seasonal events and crappy new skins.,RKZPMyAvEXs

@justuknown4059,1,Jesus loves you all  He even died for you.  He went the most vile pain in this world . But he rose back up and now He will be returning. So please repent before it’s too late. God our gracious father has given us the best gift that can be offered in existence. It’s eternal life with him when Jesus the Lamb of God returns and a relationship with Him. He even offers more than that. All because He truly loves us. He can heal you from everything that draining and dragging you down. Everything that you struggle with; all the pain that you suffer daily and weekly. He knows what you need. He wants to heal you  you just have to let him. Trust in him and have faith that it will be done. Nothing in the is world can take away what you gone through and suffered. This world only provides temporary comfort. But Jesus can set you free from it completely and permanently. Don’t trust this world  because it will deceive and keep you in that dark place that you are in. Nothing in this world will give you peace nor heaven but only the one who created it. Jesus loves you❤️❤️ 	◦,9mEhaQQ0C8Y

@FlipSwch,3,Gawr Gura thank you for everyhting these past years... What a final song to release to the world. You are an legendary shark leaving behind your mark in history. 🥲,twUFbqyul_M
@Athrun013,3,You've distilled so much raw emotion into this project Gura; if this is to be your swan song  you couldn't have done it any better. In five minutes  you've given every fan closure on your journey in Hololive  and some semblance of understanding why you've made your choice. Thank you for all these years of laughs  tears  songs  and comfort. Best of luck in the future Gura  and I can't wait to see you in your next endeavor. You'll forever be our little sharky 💗,twUFbqyul_M

@ChumChumbie,2,It's a beautiful song. It's hard to listen to though. It makes me feel things I've been trying not to feel. I've listened to it several dozen times anyway. I can't stop myself.,twUFbqyul_M

@kaioura,2,This is one of the most breathtaking songs I've ever listened to  your voice  the beautiful writing and overall direction for this project is absolutely incredible.. I'm in tears  we're all so proud of you of how far you've come Gura.. ;;  I hope wherever this door leads you to next is filled with so much more happiness and peace. ♡ Thank you for everything and for being one of the biggest inspirations for so many around the world  your legacy will never be forgotten. 💙,twUFbqyul_M
@MoriMukuro,2,🦈🦈🦈,twUFbqyul_M
@mrDingleberry44,2,Outstanding video among outstanding videos. This was a great song and another fantastic animation.  I'm so sad Gura is leaving. She literally was the first VTuber that I started following and my introduction to Hololive. I hope her other self reanimates; that would make the loss just a little less. But I will always appreciate everything that was given. The hard work from Gura  and really all of Myth  is appreciated. I wish Gura all the best for her future and happiness in wherever or whatever she chooses.,twUFbqyul_M
@CaptainAries,2,o7 end of an era for sure glad I got to be here for all those years and remember lads  don't be sad because it's ending  be happy it happened and Gura... thanks  simply thanks,twUFbqyul_M

@colethomas790,1,i found it. my favorite style of animation. a twisted  unsightly Frankenstein's amalgamation of cell shading  3D  and fake stop motion thats jerky  smeary  flashbangy  and so spastic as to scratch my microplastic addled zoomer brain like a max0r video. it's over the top and just plain fun to watch.  it somehow invokes a freakish combination of the most bonkers  aneurism inducing source filmaker and stick figure animations i'd spend hours watching as a kid  and all the brain chemisrty altering imagery of golden age cartoon network. i cant wait for more.,IC8KsZniulw

I feel like I just watched the entire first season of a show condensed to less than half an hour and it's only the first episode (I mean this in the best way possible). This is one of the most stylistically unique animated shows I've ever seen. It's like y'all took multiple different animation aesthetics and mashed them together to create something new.

@Ghostmanriding,118,Good to see the top three  Robinson  Patterson and Boling under 45 sec.,VX-7ULUrssc
@da5863,104,Erriyon ran 45.37 earlier this month so he was definitely just not at his best due to running an hour before. You have to give respect where it’s due though  Fred Kerley  Letsile Tebogo  and Michael Norman are in a league of their own having run world class times from the 100 all the way up to the 400.,VX-7ULUrssc
@SPIDERM0OSE,76,I wanna see Kerley n Lyles beefing n having showdowns over 300m,VX-7ULUrssc
@gtrdoc911,53,Love it when sprinters are humbled by the 400.,VX-7ULUrssc
@markadams7328,38,Thanks for not making this a 14 minute video!! 4 minutes was plenty to get your point across.,VX-7ULUrssc
@kwd-2023,28,Boling  WOW! Love that guys runs!,VX-7ULUrssc
@christophersmith3254,26,I think it's dope to see them competing without fear,VX-7ULUrssc
@TheGreatness-gg1jx,17,Noah and Erriyon should run more 4s. It'll drop their 200 times significantly.  Shout out to Boling finding his stride. Good to see him finding his groove.,VX-7ULUrssc
@Xx-po1fu,13,This is so silly  if Lyles had ran under 10 seconds in the 100m and under 20 seconds in the 200m at the Grand Slam event he would be $200 000 richer. This Tom Jones Memorial Invitational does not provide prize money for the winners.,VX-7ULUrssc
@davidhunternyc1,13,Will any one person ever own world records in the 100m  200m  and 400m? An Olympic Gold medal in all three races would be genius level too.,VX-7ULUrssc
@anselmolawrence839,12,The 400 is a big man race,VX-7ULUrssc
@dalilkwickone14,12,Noah looks bulky,VX-7ULUrssc
@crosslink1493,11,Lyles could run faster.  I'm not sure if its his conditioning or if he needs to work on his pacing through the race.  Good to see the former 'wonderkid' Matthew Boling get under 45 in April  and also good going to the other two who got down in the 44s.,VX-7ULUrssc
@kennethwoods6525,11,Ummmm. Did Fred Kerley just run 44.73 at Mt. Sac?,VX-7ULUrssc
@johnthies1150,9,Aren't you gonna cover Shelly Ann Frasier Price's complete domination at her son's sports day parents race? 😂,VX-7ULUrssc
@SkyTurnsPurplePhotography,9,Lyles is not a 400m guy  but I am sure he was satisfied getting to stretch his legs and see where he was at.   -Doubt he'll run another one anytime soon.,VX-7ULUrssc
@darrylb5247,8,I predict Boling to drop to 44.0 by the end of this year. He's still young and finishes well!,VX-7ULUrssc

@_akshara_798,3,Can't we just stop fandom wars  the haters and anti's just why are they there to hate artists  if you hate or don't like them ignore them  don't listen or watch  just ignore. Why hate them? even their humans who have went through years of rigorous training but still don't give up and come this far and even they feel like giving up and they too feel lonely! So please we can't stop hater and anti's but as fandoms of different groups or artists  we know what our idols go through and that's exactly what other idols go through too. We are millions in each fandoms can't we unite together and shower them with love and praises so they don't feel lonely or so they don't feel like they're not loved. The fandoms keep fighting among each other while their idols are great friends & respect each other very much cuz they know best of the difficulties they faced so why are we as fans ruining their friendship? Maybe we don't see their friendship on screen but not everything is to be shown to us fans. Bcz of us idols who are friends are also scared to interact  we are ruining their friendship and we as fans can't support idols personaly like their friends do so please we don't know what happens behind the camera  we don't know how the idol feel deep in their heart  we don't know how close they are to each other. When we don't know these details who are we to hate them just bcz we are millions and that pressures them. No one is perfect  every human is imperfect but ofcourse everyone wants to be perfect  so are idols imperfect bcz of some mistakes they make they receive massive hate why? Don't we make mistakes? But we're not targeted or hated by millions of people bcz of that. They get plastic surgery bcz of the hate they would get for being ugly by the public and the toxic KBS standards  we hate them for things they do because of us and for us. If you don't like the type of music or anything about other groups or idols don't hate them  ignore them bcz fanwars do harm for their and your idol(every idol) it ruins any possible friendship or interaction and if you hate an idol do you think their fandom won't start hating your idols  and that's exactly what fandom wars are  theres no point it does barm for both so let's just stop please  let idols do what they want  live how they want  after all it's their life and everyone only lives once so why waste our time hating and talking shit about someone that we don't know personally. Let's enjoy our lives supporting our groups and idols and leave the others  that way even idols will get to live freely. Let's lower our TOXIC Standards of expecting idols who are also humans to be perfect and hating them for their little imperfections. If someone would just remind moonbin how loved he was and IS maybe he would've been with us😢 if just every idol knew their worth  the precious lives wouldn't have been lost😭.  RIP Moonbin 🌕 you are the brightest light in the dark i hope you know that💗. I cried while writing this paragraph bcz of how much idols suffer and how much we as fans add to the suffering🤧,UUFJlUy5aA4

Jesus died and resurrected so YOUR sins could be forgiven. He loves you so much He suffered and gave His life for you so you may believe in Him and have eternal life. Change your heart and turn to Jesus. “Jesus said to him  ‘I am the way  the truth  and the life. No one comes to the Father except through Me.’” John 14:6.

@wobert2485,4,please be a good movie,Rq5LyXG8m2U
@TheNyxmaster,3,Always been a big Superman fan — never really got into the whole DC Universe with all the heroes mixed together. But James Gunn's got a solid track record. This movie feels like a tightrope walk: it could go full epic  Avengers-level hype  and leave us begging for more… or crash hard and bury the last hope we had for Superman for the next 30–40 years. Let’s be real — superhero films are in a bit of a slump right now. This one could either reignite the spark… or be the nail in the coffin.,Rq5LyXG8m2U

@darkisis22,28,10:31 bartender here  I love this part! Haha  the “awaken” technique with herbs is actually a thing!

@elladawn89,3,great song  cool video. First thing I noticed was how clearly it seems to reference photographer Sasha Elage's work. So much so that I went to the description to see if he had worked on it. His style is so distinct  horses  bright pinks  almost misty qualities to his photos (okay kinda vague but I'm telling you google his work and you will immediately see the parallels!) Referencing talented artists rocks  art is made to inspire and to be shared and reinterpreted  but credit them ffs. You would know Sasha's work if you saw it  this MV is a direct reference and could've been such an awesome boost to his work and career  and still can be!!! I understand Addison posted an instagram story but the credit should be permanently attached to this video  the actual thing that took inspiration and will be seen by the majority of people.,XdFpzaM07i0

@shuko_0,1,mia flinching at the smell of the snickers cookie is so real LOL  "smells like death" is also one of my catchphrases as a peanut allergy sufferer,bxlzbJPvwK8
@marielinderholm5767,1,Actually they weren't wrong  peanuts are not a nut. They are the worst name though because so many people assume they are a nut because of the name. Almonds are not a nut either. So if you are allergic to nuts you can eat peanuts and almonds. If you are allergic to all of them you might need to be more explicit about it in restaurants and similar places 😊,bxlzbJPvwK8
@lucifriday6288,1,Crumbl started in Utah and there's several in Idaho  where I live. You are in US  I assume.,bxlzbJPvwK8
@wizzardgizzard,1,thoroughly enjoyed Papa Maples coming thru  love his energy so much. you and your family are the best. :),bxlzbJPvwK8
@Quickeeeee,1,Sweets really is the case of: you want it when you can't have (much of) it. When I was a student I bought sweets all the time to keep up... And after I graduated I didn't buy sweets for like two years. It just lost its appeal. And I still  many years later  don't like things that are just sweet; I only want things that have a strong flavor of something else like coco or lemon. And yeh I know sugar addiction is real  but I guess for me the association between sugar and studying was so strong and off-putting that I just didn't fall for the addiction.,bxlzbJPvwK8
@Ayushizcam,1,Brooo  so now people can watch your videos in different languages😱😱😱😱😱,bxlzbJPvwK8
@merrilee,0,i love how you mention they're not allergy friendly. i have celiac and omg they would make SO MUCH money if they released another gluten free cookie. the kardashian one was good imo as a celiac,bxlzbJPvwK8
@YaelTiferet,0,A cookie the size of your hand is "mini"?   When I think of "mini" that's not what I think of.  I'm gluten free because coeliac so I can't eat any of this though.,bxlzbJPvwK8

@helovedelaina,0,Tres Leches cake is pronounced like Thress Leh-Chess cake,bxlzbJPvwK8
@mmmariah,0,Crumbl is not allergy friendly at all.  The whole process is a cross-contamination nightmare.  If you have any nut allergy at all  I would 1000% say to avoid.  (I worked there.),bxlzbJPvwK8
@1989Sarahlicious,0,Has Mia always been allergic to nuts? I feel like I've only seen her mention it over the last 2yrs or so. 🤔,bxlzbJPvwK8

@Mariamimaria,370,Antonelli attends school.  Like  after the quali  he might open a book and study for the test with his classmates.
