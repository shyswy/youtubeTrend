@AimanHossain-j5s,2,anyways heres how to make beef wellington   Step 1 Using kitchen twine  tie tenderloin in 4 places. Season generously with salt and pepper. Step 2 Over high heat  coat bottom of a heavy skillet with olive oil. Once pan is nearly smoking  sear tenderloin until well-browned on all sides  including the ends  about 2 minutes per side (12 minutes total). Transfer to a plate. When cool enough to handle  snip off twine and coat all sides with mustard. Let cool in fridge. Step 3 Meanwhile  make duxelles: In a food processor  pulse mushrooms  shallots  and thyme until finely chopped. Step 4 To skillet  add butter and melt over medium heat. Add mushroom mixture and season with salt and pepper. Cook until liquid has evaporated and mixture is sticking to the bottom of the pan  about 10 minutes. Transfer to a bowl and let cool in fridge. Step 5 Place plastic wrap down on a work surface  overlapping so that it’s twice the length and width of the tenderloin. Arrange the prosciutto on the plastic wrap into a rectangle that’s big enough to cover the whole tenderloin. Spread the duxelles evenly and thinly over the prosciutto. Step 6 Place tenderloin at the bottom of the prosciutto. Roll meat into prosciutto-mushroom mixture  using plastic wrap to roll tightly. Tuck ends of prosciutto as you roll  then twist ends of plastic wrap tightly into a log and transfer to fridge to chill (this helps it maintain its shape). Step 7 Heat oven to 425°. Lightly flour your work surface  then spread out puff pastry and roll it into a rectangle that will cover the tenderloin (just a little bigger than the prosciutto rectangle you just made!). Remove tenderloin from plastic wrap and place on bottom of puff pastry. Brush the other three edges of the pastry with egg wash  then tightly roll beef into pastry. Step 8 Once the log is fully covered in puff pastry  trim any extra pastry  then crimp edges with a fork to seal well. Wrap roll in plastic wrap to get a really tight cylinder  then chill for 20 minutes. Step 9 Remove plastic wrap  then transfer roll to a foil-lined baking sheet. Brush with egg wash and score lightly with a sharp knife. Sprinkle with flaky salt. Step 10 Bake until pastry is golden and the center registers 120°F for medium-rare  about 40 to 45 minutes. Let rest 20 minutes before carving and serving,eo3vmt7R2Vw

@calebcopas9982,0,A legal kick. Jon is a killer period. Cry about this or that. He’s the GOAT according to everyone including Tom. Bro can pick who he wants to fight at this point he has ran through 2 generations of fighters. Tom being the next generation after that. If they fight awesome if he retire we can’t take back what he’s done.,k30TXNNzyas
@emree8833,0,Called being Dirty,k30TXNNzyas
@karlylove9791,0,I respect Jones as a champion but I don’t like how he fights old school. He’s the type of fighter to land a standing hammer fist on a dude who’s obviously KO’d on the ground just because the ref hasn’t got to him yet. I HATE that type of fighting.,k30TXNNzyas
@fxg4merr,0,Jones is a genuine psychopath  in the complete sense of the word.  Everything he does for the camera is an act  a false persona.  The moment he steps in the cage  his emotions cease to exist and he does whatever he can to win.  That  combined with his sheer athleticism  creates a type of fighter that can not be trained  only born.,k30TXNNzyas
@Ironlungwrdsmth,0,Nah  I’m almost certain it’s the eye gauging that is why people fear him.. ain’t nobody trying to go blind.. he should have to wear mittens.. he’d probably still win.. ijs.,k30TXNNzyas

@_DC_Fitcoach,0,Don't understand what everyone is so upset about. He's right  if you think destroying someone's knee is unacceptable in a sport where people collapse each other's cheek bones  break Jaws and give each other brain damage is a strange way to view the world. Especially when attacking the knee is a perfectly legal move. JJ affinity for eye pokes is a different matter as it's against the rules. When you sign the dotted line  you know your brain and legs are on the line. But your eyes are off-limits,k30TXNNzyas

@Minky90,5,Gregory: The Quiet Spark  Gregory wasn’t the kind of boy who turned heads in a crowded room. He didn’t have a booming voice  nor did he crave attention. In fact  he preferred the opposite—he liked the corners of places  the edges of conversations  and the quiet observations no one else noticed. At twelve years old  Gregory had already figured out that the world wasn’t made for boys like him  but he was okay with that.  He lived in a sleepy town called Elmridge  tucked between pine woods and a looping river that never ran dry. It was the kind of town where time moved slower and people still waved at each other from across the street. Gregory lived with his mom and little sister  Maribel  in a small white house with a blue roof and a yard full of dandelions. His father had left a few years ago—no one ever said why. Maribel was too young to remember much  and Gregory had stopped asking.  Instead  he poured himself into the things that made sense: books  puzzles  sketchpads  and the stars. Every night  he sat by his window with a flashlight and a dog-eared book about constellations. He named them all  traced their shapes with his finger against the glass  and dreamed of floating far beyond Elmridge  into a world where he didn’t feel so small.  Gregory wasn’t unhappy. He just often felt like the rest of the world spoke a different language—one made of loud voices and fast choices. At school  he sat in the middle row  never the front  never the back. He was always kind but rarely noticed. His classmates didn’t tease him  but they didn’t invite him either. To them  he was just Gregory  a quiet boy who liked to draw and never got into trouble.  But beneath his calm surface lived a storm of imagination.  Gregory saw stories everywhere. In the way the wind moved through the trees like it had a secret  in the cracks on the sidewalk that looked like maps to invisible lands  in the pattern of raindrops racing down a car window. He filled journals with these ideas—pages and pages of strange cities  talking animals  heroes with crooked smiles  and villains with sad eyes.  No one really knew about this part of him. Not even his mother. She worked long hours at the diner and came home tired. Still  she always kissed his forehead and asked about his day. Gregory always said it was “fine ” and she would smile and ruffle his hair.  One spring afternoon  everything changed.  It started with a flyer on the school bulletin board: “Young Writers and Artists Fair – Ages 10-14. Submit your work by April 30th!” Gregory stared at it for a long time. Part of him ached to be part of something like that  to be seen  to be heard. But the louder part—the one that whispered fears—told him he wasn’t good enough. That his stories were too weird  too quiet  too… him.  He walked past the flyer every day  never touching it.  Until Miss Keller noticed.  She was his English teacher  one of the few adults who seemed to understand Gregory. She had wild gray hair and glasses that sat low on her nose. She read poetry aloud with her whole body and said things like “words are just the beginning of the story.” One day after class  she tapped Gregory’s shoulder gently.  “I’ve read your journal entries ” she said. “You have a rare voice.”  Gregory froze. “You… read them?”  She nodded  smiling. “Only the ones you submitted. You should enter the fair.”  He hesitated. “I don’t think I’m good enough.”  Miss Keller kneeled so her eyes were level with his. “Gregory  sometimes the world needs quiet stories the most. Yours made me feel something. That matters more than you think.”  With trembling fingers  Gregory picked his favorite story—a tale about a boy who turned invisible but learned to shine by helping others. He stayed up late polishing it  drawing the cover by hand. On April 30th  with his heart in his throat  he submitted it.  Weeks passed.  He convinced himself nothing would come of it. Life returned to its usual rhythm. Until one Thursday morning  the principal made an announcement over the intercom: “We’d like to congratulate Gregory Hale for winning first place in the Elmridge Young Writers and Artists Fair.”  The classroom gasped. Heads turned.  Gregory?  Gregory sat frozen  mouth slightly open. His palms were sweating. Miss Keller turned from the front of the class and gave him a wink.  That afternoon  everything shifted.  Kids came up to him  asking what his story was about. One girl said her little brother loved the characters. Someone even asked for an autograph. But the best moment came when he got home. His mom was waiting with tears in her eyes and Maribel was holding the printed book with Gregory’s name on the cover like it was made of gold.  That night  they celebrated with takeout and chocolate cake. Gregory didn’t stop smiling.  But what stayed with him most wasn’t the trophy or the praise—it was the feeling that maybe  just maybe  his quiet spark mattered. That his way of seeing the world wasn’t strange  but special. That being invisible sometimes made you the best observer. And sometimes  the best observers tell the most powerful stories.  Gregory didn’t become loud. He didn’t need to. But he walked a little taller  spoke a little clearer  and kept writing  knowing that somewhere out there  someone needed the stories only he could tell.  Want a continuation or maybe the same character placed in a fantasy or sci-fi world next?,cvpDdb4GSrI

Pete deserves more than anyone to be in  he’s gambling had no effect and was never related to any game he could impact. Kuhn the com migrated Rose bottom line it appeared to be personal.,aOQeGRQ9RQM
@iknowwhoiam6092,0,Rose  Bonds and Clemons are 3 of the greatest and not in the Hall is disrespectful,aOQeGRQ9RQM
@kevinquiroz630,0,Pete deserves to be in the hall it’s been too long,aOQeGRQ9RQM
@edwinhenry7531,0,We have a 34 time felon as president but the moral police are keeping players out of the hall of fame!  Doesn’t make sense!,aOQeGRQ9RQM

@mikeshoemaker596,0,hall of fame is a total joke without pete rose in it smh,aOQeGRQ9RQM
@jimmydavis1385,0,Amen it's time to put those fellows in there. I haven't followed any teams since I got so pissed off about the hall of fame started that crap.,aOQeGRQ9RQM
@ligafftheindifferent3495,0,He is not helping his case.  Trying to argue that steroids should be ignored makes him looks stupid.   Saying he "make a mistake" makes him look stupid.  He broke the rules.  Hedeserveds punishment.   I think being banned from the hall is an overstep when it comes to punishment  but if you are aware of the Black Sox  you can at least understand why MLB was so prone to be so harsh.,aOQeGRQ9RQM

@keithpatton1864,0,I don’t know about Roger Clements and Barry Bonds. They cheated to beat records but for God sakes Pete Rose got all those hits because of his natural God-given talent and without performance enhancers,aOQeGRQ9RQM

@N1k4_Gr1v,7,Only a quarter  This guy is legendary precise,lcrwjlrflt4
@neatstuff1988,3,As a pilot of 50 years now retired major airline it's more than normal that Kobe would not recognize the danger that he was in that day. He was so wonderful at one thing but in another thing he needed more  education. A safety pilot along would have given them another opinion or call it another conscience in instrument weather. I know he wouldn't have played any more professional Ball but I do miss his contribution to the Lakers. rest in peace Kobe and company.😢,lcrwjlrflt4
@kirbyaugustine761,1,Kobe had complete mastery of the game and himself.,lcrwjlrflt4
@jbroadbelt6,1,His last game he ever played he took FIFTY SHOTS.  And only scored 60 points.  Pathetic.,lcrwjlrflt4
@ryouarozado1350,1,That Looks Like A Quarter Of An Inch Too Tall According To The Stick  And Not A Quarter Of An Inch Too Short Because If It Was Too Short  Kobe Would Probably Get It More Than If It Was Too Tall.,lcrwjlrflt4
