MORE ABOUT ME

I'm Anne of All Trades. In NASHVILLE, I have a woodworking, blacksmithing and fabrication shop, a selection of furry friends, and an organic farm. Whether you've got the knowledge, tools, time or space to do the things you've always wanted to do, everything is ""figureoutable."" 

I became ""Anne of All Trades"" out of necessity. With no background in farming or making things, I wanted to learn to raise my own food, fix things when they break and build the things I need. 

12 years ago I got my first pet, planted my first seed and picked up my first tool. 

My goal is to learn and share traditional techniques and skills while showing my peers how to get from where they are to where they want to go, how to do the things they are passionate about, and what can be done TODAY to engage their own community and grow deep roots. 

Whether it's carving spoons, making my own hand tools, restoring my antique truck or growing heirloom tomatoes, the farm and workshop definitely keep me busy and support - whether financially through Patreon, through shopping my affiliate links, through buying merchandise, plans or project videos, or even just liking, commenting, and sharing my content with others helps me GREATLY to keep producing quality content to share.

Get a better roadmap of how to grow deep roots and live the life you want by subscribing to this channel and be sure to check out my blog for even more info https://anneofalltrades.com

We made a quick trip to Nashville to celebrate three of my siblings’ birthdays—plus a special one for our little guy Zade, who just turned three! We soaked up the family time, cheered on our nephew at his baseball game, and enjoyed just hanging out and being together.

After heading back home, the kids jumped right into one of their favorite things—swim lessons! They’re becoming total water bugs and seriously never want to get out of the pool. It’s been so fun to watch them grow and gain confidence in the water.

Carlin also got treated to a sweet birthday outing! Her sisters surprised her with a Color Analysis, and she had the best time! It was such a fun and thoughtful gift.

We wrapped up the vlog with a little pregnancy update—Carlin is officially 17 weeks along! We chatted about her cravings, symptoms, and what we’re praying for as we get closer to meeting baby #3.

Thanks so much for being here, for supporting our fam, and for always being so kind in the comments.

About Sierra and Stephen IRL
I’m Sierra Schultzzie and on this channel you'll find my husband Stephen & I sharing our daily life, navigating parenthood, finding adventures wherever we can, and of course some Disneyland trips (we did meet there, after all). After almost ten years of vlogging, we love that we still get to share our lives with you as we continue to grow and enter new phases of life.

Welcome back to Inferior Interiors, where we take the rooms YOU send us and reimagine them! This week, we're tackling outdated boho spaces—think Urban Outfitters circa 2015…Yep, we’ve all been there. While we still love the boho vibe, some pieces can easily date a room—like thin wall tapestries, certain macrame plant hangers, and those classic disco balls. Join Kelsey, Becky, and Rochelle as they show how they’d refresh these spaces with an elevated boho twist. Let us know which room is your favorite and if you’ve still got any of these 2015 staples hanging around in your own place.
