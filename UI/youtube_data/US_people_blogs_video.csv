Confused? LONG STORY SHORT:
My name is Jess! I had a daughter (Lilia) at age 18 w/ my high school sweetheart. We mutually split up & co-parent to this day. I met someone new, got married at age 19, had twin boys (Kyson & Kaden) and another son (Landen). He cheated, we split ways, and I want granted sole custody of the boys ever since. After juggling life as a single mom of 4 kids for some time, I met Chris, he had 2 sons, who eventually became my step sons. After Chris and I got married, we had our 7th child together, Addelyn. We‚Äôre one big, complicated, blended family & every second of our story is on YouTube, you can start from the beginning here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oz91Pnzp6tg",3Pbk8RmZBWU,1919,2025-04-21T20:53:24.000Z,"[family, vlog, vloggers, daily, fam, mommy, home, california, vlogs, parent, blended, family vloggers, coparenting, blended family, lifestyle, disney vlogger]","7 kids, 3 schedules, and a WHOLE lot of *Spring Break* DRAMA!

MORE ABOUT ME

I'm Anne of All Trades. In NASHVILLE, I have a woodworking, blacksmithing and fabrication shop, a selection of furry friends, and an organic farm. Whether you've got the knowledge, tools, time or space to do the things you've always wanted to do, everything is ""figureoutable."" 

I became ""Anne of All Trades"" out of necessity. With no background in farming or making things, I wanted to learn to raise my own food, fix things when they break and build the things I need. 

12 years ago I got my first pet, planted my first seed and picked up my first tool. 

My goal is to learn and share traditional techniques and skills while showing my peers how to get from where they are to where they want to go, how to do the things they are passionate about, and what can be done TODAY to engage their own community and grow deep roots. 

Whether it's carving spoons, making my own hand tools, restoring my antique truck or growing heirloom tomatoes, the farm and workshop definitely keep me busy and support - whether financially through Patreon, through shopping my affiliate links, through buying merchandise, plans or project videos, or even just liking, commenting, and sharing my content with others helps me GREATLY to keep producing quality content to share.

Get a better roadmap of how to grow deep roots and live the life you want by subscribing to this channel and be sure to check out my blog for even more info https://anneofalltrades.com
