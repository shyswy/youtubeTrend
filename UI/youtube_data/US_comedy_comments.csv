@S3cn3_4Ever,2,"If you guys don't understand, many old asians never went to school or were born in  a hospital. They lived in a moutain or somewhere not in a hospital. They hunted many animals to make their own food, which is why many asians love food made by animals. When they (asians) grow older, people or them had to make up their own birthdays.",02QsLWnBE74

As long as it’s older than 1950, which, if this episode was made anytime before 2019, it would have been, the photo paper itself is the proof because it was taken and processed after a date more than 65 years ago.",02QsLWnBE74
