Makes their day and makes mine too. Who knows what type of day they're having with all the crazy people out there. A little kindness doesn't cost much but can change a person's whole day and mood.

Also... there's an added benefit to it too because the delivery guys most definitely remember the ones who give them snacks. And they usually return the favour by being very considerate when delivering a package. It's a bonus win. :D",tvwKsRx16zo

Always appreciated the houses that acknowledge that it was real work. What most people don’t understand is that you never get a real break to eat, drink, or pee; God forbid, if you ever had to poop. It was the most dehumanizing job I’ve ever had. I will always respect the delivery drivers and love the people who show kindness and respect: most will treat you like dirt who dares to stain their property even if you’re just delivering what they ordered. Absolutely one of the most dehumanizing job I’ve ever had.",tvwKsRx16zo
