About A Minecraft Movie: 
From Warner Bros. Pictures and Legendary Pictures and starring Jason Momoa and Jack Black, A Minecraft Movie, directed by Jared Hess, is the first ever big screen, live-action adaptation of Minecraft, the best-selling video game of all time. Welcome to the world of Minecraft, where creativity doesn't just help you craft, it's essential to one's survival! Four misfits—Garrett ""The Garbage Man"" Garrison (Momoa), Henry (Hansen), Natalie (Myers) and Dawn (Brooks)—find themselves struggling with ordinary problems when they are suddenly pulled through a mysterious portal into the Overworld: a bizarre, cubic wonderland that thrives on imagination. To get back home, they'll have to master this world (and protect it from evil things like Piglins and Zombies, too) while embarking on a magical quest with an unexpected, expert crafter, Steve (Black). Together, their adventure will challenge all five to be bold and to reconnect with the qualities that make each of them uniquely creative…the very skills they need to thrive back in the real world.

Lyrics:

Don’t let me down easy 
If you’re gonna leave me 
Baby go and leave me all the way 
Don’t ask for all your things back
Cussin’ out my name yeah
Just to go and take back what you say 
Burn all the bridges 
Don’t ask forgiveness
Walk away like I’m someone you hate 
Don’t let me down easy 
If you’re gonna leave me 
Baby go and leave me all the way

Aye, if it's over it's over so f*ck it
Just don't act like my love wasn't nothing 
Like I wasn't the one you was holding at night telling all your secrets and hugging
Cause you right, it's too good to be true
Was a point all I needed was you 
But sh*t time after time all this fussing and fighting it's time you do what you do
And it's cool, mama said there was fish in the sea 
I got lost in the pool
Knew it was coming, I watched how you move, 
how you turned your back on me and leave Me to lose
Remember the text how you said that you do
Said that you'd never leave we would fight til it’s due
But as it went on I was fighting for you
Sent a text it turned green why the f*ck it ain't blue 
Guess you gone and I get it
Said you stay and you wanted my name but you left so I'm guessing that  you never meant it 
Said you’d try and hold on cause the love was so strong now I'm standing alone in this kitchen
Singing sad songs but I'm knowing that this sh*t don't last long
If you're leaving then leave cause your bags gone
But just know that you can never come back home

Don’t let me down easy 
If you’re gonna leave me 
baby go and leave me all the way 
Don’t ask for all your things back
Cussin’ out my name yeah
Just to go and take back what you say 
Burn all the bridges 
Don’t ask forgiveness
Walk away like I’m someone you hate 
Don’t let me down easy 
if you’re gonna leave me 
baby go and leave me All the way

Aye, if you say that you done then no takes backs 
Said you fell outta love and I hate that
But see me I was stuck like a drug really fiening for love and somehow I can't shake back
When you walked out that door I was hurting
All the dreams in my head you was perfect
You remember the very first time that we chilled and I reached for your hand where the nerves at
Time will pass cause sh*t that’s what it do it be time I be sick sitting thinking about you 
It was death do us apart till you gave me the blues 
Really played with my heart had me lost in the view
Thought this sh*t was fair game but you made up the rules 
On my hear left a scar and a bruise
Hope that you can stand on all the sh*t that you did cause I’m done 
Yeah I’m finally through

Don’t let me down easy 
If you’re gonna leave me 
Baby go and leave me all the way 
Don’t ask for all your things back
Cussin’ out my name yeah
Just to go and take back what you say 
Burn all the bridges 
Don’t ask forgiveness
Walk away like I’m someone you hate 
Don’t let me down easy 
If you’re gonna leave me 
Baby go and leave me all the way

Azizam Lyrics:

Azizam
Meet me on the floor tonight
Show me how to move like the water
In between the dancing lights
Be mine be mine
Azizam

I wanna be nowhere but here with you now
I wanna be one in this space
I wanna be tangled and wrapped in your cloud
I wanna be close to your face

Well tomorrow can wait
Losing time in this place
Till the sun is awake
Be like a magnet on me

I don’t care what they say
We can do it our way
And if love’s just a game
Then come and play

Azizam
Meet me on the floor tonight
Show me how to move like the water
In between the dancing lights
Be mine be mine
Azizam

Azizam
Azizam

I wanna get lost in your ocean and drown
I wanna be careless and free
I wanna live here in the moment we found
I wanna be all that you see

Well tomorrow can wait
Losing time in this place
Till the sun is awake
Be like a magnet on me

I don’t care what they say
We can do it our way
And if love’s just a game
Then come and play

Azizam
Meet me on the floor tonight
Show me how to move like the water
In between the dancing lights
Be mine be mine

LYRICS
 
Put your headphones on
Guess I gotta accept the pain
Need a cigarette to make me feel better
Every good thing comes my way
So I
Still get dolled up
 
Guess I gotta accept the pain
Need a cigarette to make me feel better
Every good thing comes my way
So I
So I put my headphones on
 
I put my headphones on
Listen to my favorite song
(Listen to my favorite song)
Soaking up the rain
Letting my hair down
So I put my headphones on
Come and put your headphones on
 
Wish my mom and dad could’ve been in love
Guess some things aren’t meant to last forever
I compare my life to the new it girl
Jealousy’s a rip tide, it pulls me under
 
You can’t fix what has already been broken
You just have to surrender to the moment
 
Guess I gotta accept the pain
Need a cigarette to make me feel better
Every good thing comes my way
So I
Still get dolled up
 
Guess I gotta accept the pain
Need a cigarette to make me feel better
Every good thing comes my way
So I
 
So I put my headphones on 
(I put my headphones on)
Listen to my favorite song
(Listen to my favorite song)
Soaking up the rain
Letting my hair down
So I put my headphones on
 
Come and put your headphones on
Listen to my favorite song
 
I know the lows are what makes the highs higher
So I tell myself this as a reminder
Life’s no fun through clear waters
 
You can’t fix what has already been broken
You just have to surrender to the moment
 
Guess I gotta accept the pain
Need a cigarette to make me feel better
Every good thing comes my way
So I
Still get dolled up
 
Guess I gotta accept the pain
Need a cigarette to make me feel better
Every good thing comes my way
So I
 
So I put my headphones on
(I put my headphones on)
Listen to my favorite song
(Listen to my favorite song)
Soaking up the rain
Letting my hair down
So I put my headphones on
 
Gonna dance
Gonna dance
Till the wheels fall off
You know I can’t get enough
 
Gonna dance
Gonna dance
Till the wheels fall off
You know I can’t get enough
 
Gonna dance
Gonna dance
Till the wheels fall off
You know I can’t get enough
 
Gonna dance
Gonna dance
Till the wheels fall off

Letra / Lyrics

Si te olvido
Platícame la historia de nosotros
Cuéntame de dónde te conozco
Para ver si así recuerdo poco a poco

Si te olvido
Cuéntame por qué me enamoré
Y cómo te preparas el café
Dame el primer beso por segunda vez
¿Cuál fue la primer balada que te dediqué?
Si te olvido, solo cuenta que te amé

Amé
Las mañanas que empezaban con un beso
Cuando el aire despeinaba tu cabello
El brillo en el anillo de tu dedo

Y amé
Cuando cada luna fue luna de miel
Dibujarnos las arrugas en la piel
Si te olvido, nunca olvides que te amé
Amén

Amé
Las mañanas que empezaban con un beso
Cuando el aire despeinaba tu cabello
El brillo en el anillo de tu dedo

Y amé
Cuando cada luna fue luna de miel
Dibujarnos las arrugas en la piel
Si te olvido, nunca olvides que te amé
Amén
