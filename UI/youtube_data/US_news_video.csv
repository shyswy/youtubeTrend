Y‚Äôall, Terrence Howard just brought evidence of Diddy allegedly his adopted daughter, Ava, and things are about to get out of hand. We thought that Terrence was done with Diddy when he claimed that Diddy tried to put moves on him, but it turns out that Terrence might know more than he told us on the podcast.

And get this: it looks like the feds have caught on to this, because they just updated the indictment against Diddy. They added two new charges and included new victims to the original list of charges. Well, word on the streets is that Ava is allegedly one of the new victims. And like that‚Äôs not crazy enough, rumor has it that she will be taking the stand to testify against Diddy in the trial.

Things are starting to heat up, and it looks like Terrence just might be the one to take Diddy down, so let‚Äôs break this down.

news,23,Washington Post Universe,2752,US,"The U.S. dollar is an early casualty of President Donald Trump‚Äôs us-against-the-world trade war.
The dollar has lost almost 10 percent of its value since Inauguration Day, with more than half of that decline coming this month after the president‚Äôs decision to lift taxes on imported goods to their highest level since 1909.


The weaker dollar ‚Äî now near a three-year low against the euro ‚Äî is bad news for Americans traveling abroad and could also aggravate inflation by making foreign goods more expensive. U.S. exporters, however, should gain.

The drop is especially striking because countries that impose tariffs usually see their currency rise. But the wobbly rollout of Trump‚Äôs¬†tariff plans¬†‚Äî with the president and his aides contradicting themselves about key details ‚Äî left investors doubting the administration‚Äôs competence.

news,24,The Lead Attorney,5828,US,"In the summer of 2023, New York Attorney General Letitia James helped her niece, Shamice Thompson-Hairston, buy a home in Norfolk, Virginia, by co-signing the mortgage. Now, this seemingly simple transaction has sparked a heated debate, with a top Trump administration housing official accusing James of bank fraud. William Pulte, the Director of the U.S. Federal Housing Finance Agency, has requested the U.S. Department of Justice to launch a criminal investigation, citing discrepancies in James' mortgage application and her claims regarding the property‚Äôs primary residence status.

James, known for her legal battles with former President Donald Trump, has called these allegations ‚Äúbaseless‚Äù and claims they are part of a political retribution campaign. The controversy revolves around whether James misrepresented her primary residence, potentially violating mortgage rules, and whether she misrepresented the number of apartments in her Brooklyn townhouse to secure federal mortgage benefits.

In this video, we break down the key details surrounding the investigation into Letitia James‚Äô real estate dealings, including the loan application, power of attorney, and conflicting statements regarding her primary residence. Is this a legitimate legal issue or just another political attack in the ongoing battle between Trump‚Äôs allies and his legal adversaries?

Stay tuned as we dive deep into the bank fraud allegations and the potential fallout for Letitia James, one of the most powerful legal figures in the country.
