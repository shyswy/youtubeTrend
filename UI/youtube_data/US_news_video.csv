Y‚Äôall, Terrence Howard just brought evidence of Diddy allegedly his adopted daughter, Ava, and things are about to get out of hand. We thought that Terrence was done with Diddy when he claimed that Diddy tried to put moves on him, but it turns out that Terrence might know more than he told us on the podcast.

And get this: it looks like the feds have caught on to this, because they just updated the indictment against Diddy. They added two new charges and included new victims to the original list of charges. Well, word on the streets is that Ava is allegedly one of the new victims. And like that‚Äôs not crazy enough, rumor has it that she will be taking the stand to testify against Diddy in the trial.

Things are starting to heat up, and it looks like Terrence just might be the one to take Diddy down, so let‚Äôs break this down.

news,25,The Bulwark,2860,US,"CBS just took a major hit to its journalistic credibility. In a stunning memo, 60 Minutes Executive Producer Bill Owens announced his resignation, saying he could no longer make independent decisions about the show‚Äôs content. Why? Pressure from the Trump-aligned right, a bizarre lawsuit over a Kamala Harris interview, and a looming Paramount merger that needs government approval.

Tim Miller and Sarah Longwell share their take on the cowardice of institutions, the bravery of individuals, and the terrifying implications of a media ecosystem that‚Äôs bending to MAGA pressure. What does it mean when even 60 Minutes, a cornerstone of American journalism, can‚Äôt stand its ground?

news,25,Dave the Lawyer,172,US,"Senator John Kennedy and DOJ nominee Brett Shumate agree there is no legal basis for ""universal"" or ""nationwide"" injunctions during this March 26, 2025 Senate Judiciary Committee hearing. These sweeping court orders, which block federal policies beyond the parties involved, have no grounding in statute, Supreme Court precedent, or common law. Kennedy presses the point with sharp questions, while Shumate agrees: the legal foundation just isn‚Äôt there.

news,24,The Lead Attorney,7012,US,"In the summer of 2023, New York Attorney General Letitia James helped her niece, Shamice Thompson-Hairston, buy a home in Norfolk, Virginia, by co-signing the mortgage. Now, this seemingly simple transaction has sparked a heated debate, with a top Trump administration housing official accusing James of bank fraud. William Pulte, the Director of the U.S. Federal Housing Finance Agency, has requested the U.S. Department of Justice to launch a criminal investigation, citing discrepancies in James' mortgage application and her claims regarding the property‚Äôs primary residence status.

James, known for her legal battles with former President Donald Trump, has called these allegations ‚Äúbaseless‚Äù and claims they are part of a political retribution campaign. The controversy revolves around whether James misrepresented her primary residence, potentially violating mortgage rules, and whether she misrepresented the number of apartments in her Brooklyn townhouse to secure federal mortgage benefits.

In this video, we break down the key details surrounding the investigation into Letitia James‚Äô real estate dealings, including the loan application, power of attorney, and conflicting statements regarding her primary residence. Is this a legitimate legal issue or just another political attack in the ongoing battle between Trump‚Äôs allies and his legal adversaries?

Stay tuned as we dive deep into the bank fraud allegations and the potential fallout for Letitia James, one of the most powerful legal figures in the country.

Por su parte, los empresarios est√°n desesperados, dado que ya comenz√≥ la temporada de cosecha y todas las plantaciones est√°n con menos de la mitad de personal. Es m√°s: casi el 80% de los trabajadores del campo son migrantes indocumentados.

Pero no s√≥lo hablamos de la agricultura, sino de negocios como construcci√≥n, hoteler√≠a, atenci√≥n al cliente y limpieza que dependen de los inmigrantes

En respuesta, el presidente se√±al√≥ que mejorar√≠a las condiciones laborales de los trabajadores, para darles los mismos beneficios que a un estadounidense, incluyendo vacaciones, horas extras y hasta un plan de retiro.
