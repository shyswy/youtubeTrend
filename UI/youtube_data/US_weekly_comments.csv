- The Church does not cling to a male dominated institution, and anyone with even basic knowledge of the Church knows that. There are female Doctors of the Church. And we believe the greatest human that ever lived was a Woman, Mother Mary.

@gustofwindsplatoon,1,"I have to vent a bit. I am very disappointed with the kill off of Joel. And I'm somebody who loved Game of Thrones, Walking Dead, the Sopranos, Breaking Bad, etc. My core issue is that there are good ways to kill off characters, and I don't feel this was one of them. Yeah yeah I get it - ""oh it's crucial to tell the story!"". My main issue is I watched the show for Joel. The rest of the characters, Ellie included, do not interest me. In Game of Thrones with the Ned kill off, yes, it was sad, but there was such a big cast that I connected to. In any show where you kill off a main character, the viewers are always looking to ""who do I follow next"". None of the characters in the Last of Us interest me enough. Why should I care about Abby? I've seen maybe 25 minutes of her. I've seen maybe 40 minutes of Tommy. It was like when they killed off Rick in the Walking Dead. Who's left? Daryll? Not enough. The Glen kill off, ok, very sad but, I cared about the rest of the people enough to continue. I watched this show for Joel, and wow omg there's going to be a vengeance arc against some random girl named Abby, couldn't care less. I get it, it was the story of the game. Well, maybe in the game Ellie was interesting enough. But this Ellie just argues with everybody and is ultra confrontational. I want to see diversity in main characters. Joel was that 100%. When he killed off the people at the hospital, he was objectively wrong, but you cheered for him anyway. I don't care enough for Ellie as a main character because she doesn't have that. So who's next to follow? Nobody. Abby doesn't interest me enough. Wow your doctor dad who I saw for 8 seconds in season 1, why should I care? Shows need to give me a reason to care. The Sopranos for example. Tony is objectively a terrible person. But you see the complexity in his character and you cheer for him. The only reason I'd cheer for Ellie is because I loved Joel. Not because I like Ellie. I heard Ellie's character is more complex in the games and perhaps this kill off creates a beautiful vengeance arc in the game. But I'm not seeing it in the show. Very disappointed because I was really enjoying the Last of Us and figured it may reach the standard of Sopranos, Breaking Bad, etc. But I guess not.",S63tPF006fI

@MortedArt,6,"After listen and watch it for many hourss, i finally understand. 
There's two gura in the MV, the one that looks like gura (the white one at early clips) and the alter gura who step on the flowers (the red one). Both is representing gura, but..
The white one : the one we usually saw on stream, the happy one, the one who draw, play games and sing for us ( 0:23 0:36  0:45 ) and
The red one : the other sides of her, that she never show to us. Representing her anger and depression ( 0:31 0:44  0:46  ). 

The pre chorus and chorus is representing different things, it actually more towards her and 'The Ones', ""They say the memory of me is fading, i've heard it all before"" ""Don't tell me everyone around is waiting"" Is represent she is told to keep showing up consistently or everyone will start to forget her, and ""they all say, tear it down burn it down"" Is when 'The Ones' finally asked her to quit through the door, which she replied ""and they all pay, when i tear it down burn it down"". And finally ""When the world falls through and all is ashes again"" Mean when everything is done and finally over. 

The stories continue, her alter (the red one) walks towards the door followed  by gura (the white one). ""voices rise in my head, the hands that pull at my thread"" Represent all the voices and 'The Ones' that try to control her ( 1:40 ), yet her alter ignore it and still trying to quit and keep walking towards the door, destroying anything on her path ( 1:28 2:13 ). 
When her alter finally reach the door and about to open it, gura run and try to prevent her ( 2:34 ) but her alter is too strong that she's thrown away instead and drown into the sea. After drowning deep inside and thought everything is over, The Myth finally showing up one by one ( 3:39  ), holding her, carry her, pull her up, and give her courage to keep fighting and finally gura silhouette and lyrics ""ill listen carefully"" ( 3:51 ) which represents her fans who always support her and she always listen to, give her the ability and strength to fight back. 
With all that help, gura is finally able to fight her alter and winning, but in the end, they understand each others ( 4:25 )and the alter gura vanished , trusting and leaving all decision to gura. After standing for a while,Gura Finally reach to the door, open it, and ""while we all pretend if this is the end, she'll do it again""

Thank you Casey and gura for a beautiful song, and not to forget mazu for the beautiful animation that tell so much story despite the length of the videos.

@alphaedrum,2,"I just noticed at 3:59 when the two guras clash there is an impact frame of two sharks. Mazu did a wonderful job with the animation, thank you for this last collab with our wonderful gooba.

Gura and Casey, the song is amazing, period. I have been replaying it since the release, watching people react to it, even some people out of the vtuber scene are getting gaught off guard with it. Simply amazing.

Thank you Gura for this last gift, and I hope you have a wonderful future whatever you decide to do with your life. You have a lot of people cheering for you in the shadows.",twUFbqyul_M

You have to give respect where it’s due though, Fred Kerley, Letsile Tebogo, and Michael Norman are in a league of their own having run world class times from the 100 all the way up to the 400.",VX-7ULUrssc
