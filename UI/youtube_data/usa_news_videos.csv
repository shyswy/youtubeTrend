pfGdzxKFp2M,Rescatista que encontró el cuerpo de Rubby Pérez cuenta esta trágica experiencia 💥,El Nuevo Diario TV,25,뉴스,870750,17486,"El director de la Defensa Civil en el municipio Santo Domingo Norte, Miguel Marte, expresó que no había forma de que el merenguero Rubby Pérez sobreviviera al desplome del techo de la discoteca Jet Set, ya que, por la manera en que fue encontrado, era prácticamente imposible salir con vida.

Asimismo, hizo un llamado al bombero del Distrito Nacional que estuvo a su lado durante las labores de rescate y nunca lo abandonó, para que se ponga en contacto con él y así poder conocerse mejor.

El socorrista habló en esos términos al ser entrevistado por los comunicadores Jaime Rincón, Aneudy Ramírez y Nilson Batista durante el programa ""El Nuevo Diario en la Tarde"", transmitido por la plataforma digital El Nuevo Diario TV.
