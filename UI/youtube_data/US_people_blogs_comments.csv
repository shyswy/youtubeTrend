@meggtokyodelicious,2,"There's no need to take that many clothes. You can take clothes for 4 days and the rest you can buy at Uniqlo stores...... especially for kids. Avoid carrying things you don't need. 
The other solution is to take old kids clothes, kids wear them , leave in the hotel trash 🗑️, no Laundry 🧺 and no hassle. On top of that you have room in the luggage for souvenirs and gifts. I travelled around the world, it's always nicer to travel with less weight 😊",yu2rAxEq3Bk

I would worry that using this could hinder that very necessary learning experience. Babies heads are basically helmets at that age anyway and a fall from their standing height is extremely unlikely to cause real injury.

@EvarMora7607,0,"Hola, Ruthi. Puede que leas esto o puede que no. Primero que nada, felicitaciones por el cambio de casa y porque los niños ya estan en la escuela. 

Soy Lingüista especialista en Español y también profesor de Español como Lengua Extranjera / Segunda lengua por parte de la UNAM y yo enseño la variante de español mexicano a mis estudiantes en inmersión, sin embargo, entiendo que en el extranjero y para la certificación, por varias razones, se les enseña a los estudiantes extranjeros de español y de lingüística hispánica la variante ibérica o castellana. Debido a que la carrera de Yuri es para que se forme profesionalmente en español, no basta ser nativohablante para poder ayudarla en lo teórico (porque se ve mucha teoría y metalenguaje que una persona no especialista no está obligada a conocer). Te recomiendo que descargues la aplicación del diccionario de la RAE, ya que actualmente la interfaz contempla la teoria verbal de las gramáticas más importantes del español (La de la RAE y la de Andrés Bello). En el diccionario se encuentran las conjugaciones de todos los verbos existentes y también su equivalencia en español de España y de México con los nombres teoricos de cada rasgo verbal: tiempo, modo y persona. 

Además, actualmente cuenta con léxico de varios países, te ofrece sinónimos y antónimos, entre otras cosas, por lo que podria ayudarle a Yuri a estudiar. 

Soy seguidor de tu canal desde que tenía 16 (ahora ya tengo 24), así que, si alguna vez Yuri necesita ayuda, estaría encantado de resolverle dudas.

Just slow it down, focus, do one step at a time and eventually the completion will arrive.

@thenesthomestead,2,My wife and I are curious how you identify male and female plant varieties? We are newer in our homesteading journey and doing our best to learn every day <3 - Dakota & Angela,l5EBlpXgEpY
@Milen983,2,"I remember my grandpa had grafted an extremely delicious plum that I have tried only several times from the stores in my home country Armenia. They were rare variety, and I haven’t found them in any other store, those I found several times were very close but not exactly those. My point is, those grafted branches dried easily when after a while we weren’t able to regularly water that part of the garden. While the wild branches from the same tree continued to grow robustly. So we lost those nice grafted trees. Grafted trees are good but my impression is they are more fragile than the wild or seed grown ones.",l5EBlpXgEpY
@GarLic-g2f,1,Congratulations on growing your family! 🎉,l5EBlpXgEpY

@apond2895,0,"I made a mistake and bought a maple tree that was roughly 12' tall and fit into a 3-4 gallon pot. I pulled it out of the pot one day to plant it, and inside was essentially a tornado of roots circling each other. Between soaking it and hacking at the roots (trying not to damage them too bad) to free them up from the tangle, I spent probably a day and a half trying to set that tree up for success.
It's got buds now, and hopefully I did enough to give it a good trajectory. Next time I won't get the biggest tree I can find at Lowe's.
Also, totally agree about going bare-root. No more transplanting potted trees",l5EBlpXgEpY

@mirror71,2,"You're bang on with that comment about HOAs liking well-kept containers and raised beds. 

Last year, I put a 6'x4'x29"" Birdie's bed adjacent to my deck in the back of my townhome and hung some rectangular planters from the railings, all without asking or informing my HOA (~400 townhomes). It is in view of about a half dozen neighbors. Better to ask for forgiveness, right?

Throughout the season (6A), I grew tomatoes, arugula, lettuce, kale, and onions in the bed and a cucumber plant in a small grow bag beside it. Some of the planters had flowers to attract pollinators, and the rest had a rotation of leafy greens. At the end of the season, I chopped and dropped, started some garlic and seeded a mix of tall and short lavender for cover. 

A bit before the end of the season, right when the insanely productive tomatoes and cukes were at their peak, the HOA did an unannounced outdoor inspection. In the report, they said that the garden was very nice and made no further comment on it. A few months later, after the annual meeting, an email was sent out to all of the townhomes. It turns out that there was a ban on ""gardens,"" but also that I was far from the only one doing it. The board really liked seeing what everyone was doing and said it was a great thing to see because it shows happy neighbors who are engaged in caring for their community. They were lifting the garden ban and just have some rules banning certain known invasives. Raised beds and containers did not count as ""permanent modifications to the grounds,"" so lifting the ban on them is still consistent with the rules of the property documents (deeds & easements).

In addition to the obvious, this also made my back very happy because my contingency plan was to relocate all 600lbs of that to the basement and keep it going under lights, and now I did not have to do that. 

Anyway, love the content as always. Sorry for sounding like this is a paid comment (it isn't!), but I also I should mention that everything but the soil was sourced from Epic & Botanical. A+ would do again!",KoGlNGk75fQ

You know the nutrition nuts can add to your dishes so buy what ever nuts your family likes and keep them in your freezer. Purchase them in bulk with the least amount of processing and when needed use them whole or chopped as desired. We used English walnuts primarily and my job was to just break them up using my fingers, twisting them between my thumb and forefinger. It seems to eliminate the dust created by chopping with a knife.

@Brenda-e8o,7,10:50 I love watching your videos. So inspiring and grounding !! Just a little something to share that I do now that I wish my younger self knew 😂. I cook up meats when I’m cooking for a meal by cooking extra amounts. Then I have meats in fridge that week or in freezer ready to go for meals on busy days. And also… I now take bacon while it’s partially thawed and cut it in small pieces with my butcher knife and then cook it in skillet. You have bacon ready for all types of meals…Even just sprinkle in eggs as cook or some on top of cooked eggs for a quick meal.,rAKogFVjs4Y

@lisadorsi5628,37,You guys never go to school. I can’t believe Florida lets you get away with that & still pass & graduate. You could never do that in NJ you would definitely be penalized for it. We have tough laws up here & you absolutely need to go to school.,gUgTuJQWCb0
@lisadorsi5628,36,I’m glad you got caught. Mom that’s what happens when you let them do whatever they want. Mom you need to ground them & make them accountable for their actions. They do not need to go shopping. I would t let them take another day off the rest of the year.,gUgTuJQWCb0

@MarisolValdez-2024,16,Yaileny the only thing you can do is take their phone away and iPads away for a week and have a serious conversation with them about school is very important them or punished them as well so they could learn and listen what they’re doing wrong I know you are very mad at them and disappointed but I know they are to learn what they did wrong I don’t feel sorry for Ali or Emily because missing school is not right,gUgTuJQWCb0
