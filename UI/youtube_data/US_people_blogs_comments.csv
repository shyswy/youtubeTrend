@stiffin13,122,"Gas pumps in the US don’t charge you more than you need.

You swipe your card first to unlock the pump, then the final total after how many gallons you put in is what’s taken from your account.

If you’re in a budget and can only spend $20 the pump attendant can set that pre paid amount for you and then you’re set and won’t get overcharged. On the other end if you only use $15 out of that $20 then the refund you $5.",7wID3WVyrN8

The other solution is to take old kids clothes, kids wear them , leave in the hotel trash 🗑️, no Laundry 🧺 and no hassle. On top of that you have room in the luggage for souvenirs and gifts. I travelled around the world, it's always nicer to travel with less weight 😊",yu2rAxEq3Bk

@MsLuLu03,11,"Patara, I am so grateful that I started a pantry a few years back. See, I lost my full-time job back in November, and my unemployment has recently ran out, and I STILL HAVE NOT BEEN ABLE TO FIND ANOTHER JOB! Its rough out there, especially for someone like me .... 52 years young, not much college education (just took a few courses), and I have tried and tried. Starting working the day I turned 16, so I have a variety of experience, and my last position worked was for a little over 20 years of solid employment,  and still cannot get a call/email. Its like trying to win the lottery with most places using online apps. Then there is that one place, and it all looks good and you think you're going to get the job, and the job is perfect for you, then nothing. But as I stated, my pantry has helped me out IMMENSELY!

@jennyhackenberg,5,I have been feeling kinda on the depressed side this last month in a half.  It has been hard to get up off the chair to get things done.   But i have been planning my garden and extea things.  I paid off my lowes bill before Christmas and said no more buying extravagant things on it.  I so far put $180 on it for stuff i need for the garden like soil and fertilizer but i also paid almost  half of it off.  With what i got today i owe them $118.  My biggest expense was buying some big containers to plant some herbs in them.  Something has been telling me to plant things i normally would plant because i will need it for the future.  I just wish i could shake this feeling that it is all for nothing.  That no matter what i do it isn't going to be enough.   Please be safe out there everyone and god bless.,r_iVoWqYDSw

They said they like dogs for protection from other homeless and when they no longer want that dog or can't feed them, they let it go.

The list read...Coffee, sugar, tide, canned goods, and paper towels.  My mom explained the dollar losing its value in recession.  I can see her piling bags of sugar under the stairs.  That was about 55 years ago or more.  She stressed always keep even with the board...that means no debt.  I have no debt, stocked up,  and getting Dr apps done, and spending zero on junk.

America currently has an insanely irrational, demented NARCISSISTIC psychopath as president Hell bent on destroying Ukraine to somehow assuage his childish hurt feelings.  

Please be certain that nearly 100% of every sane person who possesses an IQ > 90 worldwide but to an extreme those within America are ever so strongly supportive of Ukraine against the wild assed tantrums of Donald Rump.

If during day they were tired and cranky and wanted their dummy I’d distract them etc and they’d soon be ok but that only happened in the first couple of days.

@lynnecarnivale6414,1,"Hello! The 4 prong hook is used in our home a few ways. I bought them online before COVID so I used them to hang our masks in the closet. I also use them in my sons room for his belts. I use one in the bathroom to dry items, and we own a tour bus and we use two in the back to hang light coats or bags. 
God bless you, family and viewers!

Bring a personal fan of some kind to stay cool, pack tissues/TP in your bag in case facilities run out, I also usually bring a bandana for an accessory/dry off sweat/cover my face to filter dust or dirt, and stay hydrated!

- a water pouch (at least here in Europe)  
-a carabiner to clip your purse shut so that it can’t be stolen

-a card game to pass the time",qO_6oKxT14c

But you’re teaching yourself trades and executing them at a high level.  It’s inspiring to watch.  I remind myself now when I embark on a large, detail intensive project, that I can do this.  Just slow it down, focus, do one step at a time and eventually the completion will arrive.  I’ve watched plenty of renovations done by professionals where a complicated shower installation like this has taken much longer than the timeframe you managed here.

@lindabell5534,1,I'm thinking the shower floor ties colors look different from what they look.

@lexyeast4896,3,"I saw someone recently talking about advocating for yourself at the Dr. They suggested asking the Dr to add ""Can you add a note to my chart that says, 'I asked for treatment and you refused?'"" That way, if something happens or if you get worse, there is a record of it, but 9 times out of 10 they don't want that liability so they'll reconsider what you're asking for. I haven't personally tried this yet, but it sounds like good advice. Also, I've had good luck with honey just straight from the spoon (not mixed with water or tea). I'm assuming you've tried it that way already, but that does usually help me.",VevsyFBZdP0

@iloverollypollies,2,"I am a medical advocate & I have had doctors who were refusing to order breast ultra sound and by the end of it they had it ordered and were apologizing to me. On the other end I have also had many doctors hang up on me in the middle of phone visits. LOL

If you call your insurance and ask them to refer you to a ""Care Coordinator"" or a ""Community Health Worker"" these people can attend your appointments WITH YOU to make sure you are getting the right treatment/ advocate for you in the doctors. 
If you are alone at the doctor though here are some tips for advocating for yourself 

-State how your symptoms effect your daily life (Like how you said it was keeping you up all night) 
-If the doctor doesn't ask about your symptoms before saying something negative, then call them out say ""You did not even ask about my symptoms yet"" 
- Try to book repeat appointments with doctors you enjoy/ make you feel comfortable. Eventually they could be your primary care & then you hopefully only have to see them in the future
-Fight back, give em a lil argument, they love it.  In every relationship people say ""Its healthy to have arguments because it means you are expressing all your feelings and coming to compromise"" Then how come it isnt this way with doctors? 
If you feel that your life would genuinely benefit from just a little bit of medicine, then debate, fight, site facts, state your mind.  
Say ""Yknow what, since I have kids, I actually don't have time to come back in a few days, so If you could give me medicine NOW. Thank you""",VevsyFBZdP0

@mikedoingmikethings702,1,"I grow fruit trees and vegetables here in Satans Armpits known as Las Vegas, Nv and a lot of people think that I have a ""green thumb"" for growing plants and fruit trees in my backyard... but the truth is, i killed many plants and I refused to give up...

most ""part time gardeners"" wanted to buy a tree and want them fruiting like yesterday and like you stated, most of these plants came from out of state that they may look fine for a few months, but comes summer time, the growth are stunted because of our intense heat and most of the time the trees will never recover and dies. Just like what you're doing, you are looking for plants that are either native to the area or that are ""acclimated"" to the zone/area. This is very important because plants for miraculous ways, creates tolerance to its environment, thus buying from a local hobbyist that have fruit trees growing in the area for at least one season is ideal vs from a big box stores or nurseries that stocks items from out of state...",l5EBlpXgEpY
@rockyhighwayroad7365,1,I have heard about the seeds not being true to the plant if grafting was involved but are you sure about the cuttings also being different? Cuttings are generally clones of the parent plant,l5EBlpXgEpY
@Em-ke2fe,0,I love you,l5EBlpXgEpY
@stephencline1884,0,All I can can say is that I will not buy another potted or bare root Fruit tree ever again. I have or had 3 orange trees  That died over the winter. One produced fruit before 2021 hard freeze we had one i bought one in 2023  and the last the last one in 2024. The only thing that came back was the root stock. Now you are telling me two bare root Plumb trees I bought two years ago will die in another 3 years!,l5EBlpXgEpY
@riotopia,0,"very cool info! My grandfather was into grafting trees. I didn't get into gardening until after he passed away though, so he never taught me his secrets. I remember him always being proud of his grafted vines and trees though. I think I may give it a go myself!",l5EBlpXgEpY
@joophunt5569,0,What zone or where is this land ? You’re  using it so well ? I wonder where at?,l5EBlpXgEpY
@CocoInColors,0,We have an indoor Meyer lemon tree plant. I've been considering buying a new one because I didn't know what I was doing before (though the tree lives!)... turns out I still don't know what I'm doing 😂Glad I happened to see this video before I pulled the trigger!,l5EBlpXgEpY
@BrenZZs_GIA,0,"I was told the same thing in NW Wyoming. Well, as it was, the Earth would not support. So, I altered the Earth. My fruit trees, bushes, vines, and plants, are beautiful and produce wonderfully every year.",l5EBlpXgEpY

@ElizabethE1267,0,Stick tree options are not options unless you have years to wait until those trees reach maturity.  Buy from local growers. Growers…those who grow the trees themselves in your area.,l5EBlpXgEpY
