@smathlax,2,"This wouldn't look real in real life. It can only look real from one perspective. In this case it's the camera's perspective. To the people inside it would look like a weird stretched out screen.

Think of it like this: for the shots from the corner, you can see the far-right corner of the elevator shaft but not the far-left corner. But for the shots from the middle you can see both far corners. But it's just a display, so the people inside would also see those exact corners as well regardless of where they're standing.

The only way to make this accurate would be to have just one person and have some kind of eye tracker and change the perspective on the display accordingly as the person moves. Like that scene in Mission Impossible: Ghost Protocol when they're breaking into the Kremlin.",NeXMxuNNlE8

@rakeshroy4199,0,"Hello,
This is Rakesh Roy from 
Maharashtra India. 

I don't mind saying that.  LG brand is very good but its customer service is very poor or bad. 

my water purifier not working properly since last 15 days.Product details- LG WW140NP Date of purchase 26-1-2020I complained for this 3times in this month, and 2 times your engineers also came to me.But both times they just changed the outside filter and gone.The last time an engineer named Mr. Vikas Mishra came, he did the same.on 27th June.20. his number is +919588660257.He said RO is ok now.Please call me if you have any problems. After 1hr the orange light started coming again.I called Vikas he said I come tomorrow?  But he did not come?  When I did it again yesterday, he said, I come till evening but did not come.  Then yesterday evening said, I come today, and today also did not come ??  And I have called him 5 times since the evening but he is not picking up.And now when I call him from another number he is saying, forget? and he said what you want to do just do, what will the company do??Do what you want? 

If you want I can give you call details.

I do not understand, why have such people you kept they don't have manners.  This is very bad service.It is a shame that such people are representative of the LG company.

I hope you guys maintain the reputation of such a company!!!!!

@globalhomeapplianceservice9843,0,"Worst product ever. Fooled by LG's attractive marketing & ads. ""Never buy LG OR any other Brand's front load washing machine it is total waste of money, buy only top load which is best"".

Because everytime cloths are not clean and smelling very bad after washing. All the dress are used only once and I am in work from home so, no outside work.

Imagine washing 10 cloths in just 2 liters of water in front load vs 10 cloths in 60 liters of water in top load - which will be best ?

Using for a month and tried all different programs(cycles) & options(features) water never filled atleast 1/4(quarter) of the drum. I can barely see water. I can only see little bit of foam & cloths rolling for hours over and over again.

Because front load will not use enough water at all. So, your cloths will not completely dipped in water which will never remove any dirt, stain, bacteria & gems.
After loading the cloths, some folds stay as it is even after washing completed.

All the programs(cycles) except ""cotton"" will allow only 2 kg which is just 4 cloths. So, even if you have 8 kg front load machine you can wash only 4 cloths at each time.



HUGE DISAPPOINTED. LG Display is good. But audio hardware is very poor. If you connect a headset in tv headphone output jack, you can here only voice no bass and low frequency sound. We tried with all audio and equilizer settings, but northing works.

You can watch only news. You cannot able to watch a HD movie or songs with good audio.
We tried with SD DTH, HD DTH and also with usb pendrive & I am a part time musician.

The 3.5mm headphone output jack given is no use at all, sounds like in-build speakers.
Even an 20 years old crt tv have good audio output in headphone output jack that will have all low & high frequency sounds which can be connected to any Home Theaters.

LG states this TV is ""Smart TV"" so that we will think these features will be available.",OsqQwiH8I7g

I’ve only seen people smile like that off hallucinogenics 🌄😃

But she’s not lying, though if you gonna do Hallucinogenics, you kinda gotta jump into it and be positive throughout it because that’s when the good stuff starts

Cause imagine you’re the guy on the skateboard with that feeling but terrified at the same time like tripping out & Scared that’s probably how the bad stuff starts

Being high like this 
Is a weird feeling I can’t describe it ,but  the closest thing to. It is feeling wet.  & that’s just the body 

the mind is going crazy like a roller coaster
It gets overwhelming, but then it gets calm, then back to overwhelming  then back to calm

Mushrooms always humbles you
 because you start realizing how fragile life 
And how grateful you are, that you can function the way you do 

And how sad it is, that people are mentally handicapped like that not by choice

Like schizo people 

A good mushroom trip is you knowing all that but enjoying how precious you feel in that moment

That feeling of knowing how lucky you are to even get a chance on this earth, and experience anything 🥹🌅

@pavneetkaur-u7q,0,"I had purchased LG REFRIGERATOR on 26/06/2022 from Shop MALHOTRA AIRCONDITIONING KANPUR UTTAR PRADESH, it's not been a complete year of the purchase and fridge stopped cooling. There after sales service is so poor that even their technicians are not able to identify the issue. We were given baseless reason that it too hot so the fridge will cool in this way only. There technicians gave all hit and trial with the product but even after two months they are unable to resolve the issue. Surprisingly, they are sending message that issue is resolved from their side, so they are closing the ticket. Starting from complaining to the customer care and escalating it to MD office to CEO office via the links they have provided to raise the complain online, none of them is coming up with a resolution that seems reasonable customer. Instead there entire team is asking us to purchase extended warranty for one year. We have already spent Rs. 65,000 for the fridge and now they have made it as a investment on investment product for us. Please don't purchase if you are reading this.

We have bought a dishwasher, 14 blades one just one month ago and it’s clearly a defected piece with no drying and stinking. We have been trying everything from last one month with LG but it’s just pathetic and horrible and they don’t want to do anything.
Instead 
no response from LG and the local service centre is even misbehaving and the engineer from LG has misbehaved with my family members and replying rudely.

The dishwasher is defenced piece and it’s in warranty.
Just been a month.

When they want to sale, they will make all false promises but when it comes to service then they make customer feel as if he is a begger.",5Rf8uL-bqn8

@j0seant,0,"Me he cambiado de una Corbero baratilla a una LG A+++ más cara y No-Frost y es una tortura el ruido constante que hace, la otra sin tanta pijada era bastante silenciosa. Y eso que en la publicidad la venden como silenciosa, como serán entonces las que no se venden como silenciosas. En lo de ahorrar no lo discuto, probablemente gastara mucho menos que la otra, pero cambiaria un poco de ese gasto por algo menos de ruido..",C9YD7YwAK4U
