@GGmanlife,0,"First POV 400 race that isn’t crazy fast I’ve seen! No diss, I genuinely appreciate a more realistic video. I run 52s myself, and should PR soon. Not sure if you want advice, but just something I noticed: (1) you got out pretty slow, definitely in the 13s, when the first 60 meters or so should be much hotter. You may have heard that the first ~6s is free energy, which you can choose to or not to believe, but the faster you get to a higher speed the more time you can spend at a higher speed. (2) Your 200m split, ideally, should be closer to 25.5 to efficiently run 53 flat. If you did that, therefore, you’d likely put better use to your current fitness, if even just slightly. (3) It seems like you accelerated out of the curve which is great, but if you can manage your form better then you can maximize that rotational energy. Get your knees up of course, but ultimately it’s all in the arms for the last 100m.

   Within a couple of weeks I got a letter back. It wasn't written by Michael but they sent me a few nice things including a glossy 8""x10"" that was signed by MJ. I took it to a coin and memorabilia shop back in 2001 and they said it was an authenticate signature. They offered me $70 at the time. I declined.

He was so wonderful at one thing but in another thing he needed more  education. A safety pilot along would have given them another opinion or call it another conscience in instrument weather. I know he wouldn't have played any more professional Ball but I do miss his contribution to the Lakers. rest in peace Kobe and company.😢,lcrwjlrflt4
