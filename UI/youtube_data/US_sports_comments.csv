@MistressOP,0,"Honestly, the old NCCA system robbed us of a lot of gymnastics. It was like having to choose between that and continuing to pursue the Olympics, when it really shouldn't have been that way. This was especially true for women in the sport, given how their careers used to be structured. Would have love to see her make a run at both.",DsNi-KtaN_M

@andregoree1037,0,Who cares they lost 😂😂😂😂😂,DqNMzVJrc_8
@stevekae1980,0,"Bro, I remember that Super Bowl like it was yesterday and from what the announcers were saying was Bill benched him because of something to do with he didn’t follow team protocol or rules or was late for practice , warm-ups something like that something stupid but then again you know the announcers don’t know shit they swear they do pretending to know what 2 players said to each other after the play they just sound like idiots  just making shit up. So from what people watching the game on tv were led to believe it was football related, not personal during the game from the commentators. Honestly I didn’t give 2 💩 💩 the only people that cared were Patriots fans are their children which will probably grow up to New England fans too. 😮scary",DqNMzVJrc_8

@BobBerardi,3,"I umpired as a teenager and i was doing a game with 12yr olds. A man standing behind the backstop argued about three quarters of my ball and strike calls. After taking it for a few innings, i finally called time and loudly told everyone there that the game was not going one more inning until this guy left the field. He resisted for a minute but was shouted down by the few parents there who actually cared. He left, the game went on to conclusion. This was back in the 70s.",VpwpqCDliKk

@davidcolin6519,0,"When you consider that most officials in sport do so entirely as volunteers, the idea that people would be abussive to them is beyond my comprehension. 
Some of the best coaches I've known have stood in front of the PARENTS and told them that if they misbehave, the coaches would resign. I've known this to happen twice.
I've also known the coach of a junior team for a pro club to have contracts witrh the parents that, if the parent brought the club into disrepute, the child would be out. No discussion.",VpwpqCDliKk
