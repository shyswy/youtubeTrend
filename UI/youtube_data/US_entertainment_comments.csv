@evnii-iq3du,11,"Here’s how to survive a atom bomb/ thermo Nuclear( btw ) this isn’t AI generated this took me like 8 days to fully plan this out. here’s how to survive one: Building a bunker to survive a hydrogen bomb (thermonuclear weapon) involves selecting materials that can withstand extreme pressure, heat, and radiation. While no bunker can offer 100% survival against a direct hit, certain materials and construction methods can offer significant protection. Here’s a list of materials typically used in such high-level protection bunkers:

1. Concrete (Reinforced)
	•	High-density concrete is essential to block both blast waves and radiation.
	•	Concrete is typically reinforced with steel rebar to increase its tensile strength and ability to withstand shockwaves.
	•	Thickness: Concrete walls are often several feet thick (at least 3–6 feet), depending on the design.

2. Steel
	•	Steel plates are used for additional reinforcement, particularly for doors and internal structural supports.
	•	High-strength steel alloys (e.g., tungsten steel or titanium alloys) might be used for critical areas like doors or vaults, providing a buffer against heat and pressure.

3. Lead
	•	Lead shielding is used to block radiation, particularly gamma rays.
	•	Lead is dense, making it highly effective at absorbing radiation. In some designs, it is incorporated into the walls or used as a lining.

4. Titanium
	•	Titanium alloys are used in specific high-stress areas due to their excellent strength-to-weight ratio and resistance to heat and corrosion.
	•	Titanium can be used in bunker doors to prevent warping or failure under extreme conditions.

5. Reinforced Glass
	•	Specialized radiation-proof glass may be used for viewing ports or small windows, though these would be limited in number due to the potential for breakage.
	•	The glass needs to be multi-layered and may include a combination of tungsten and silicon carbide to ensure both impact and radiation resistance.

6. Aluminum
	•	Aluminum alloys are sometimes used in parts of the structure, particularly in areas where weight reduction is necessary but where some level of protection is still required.
	•	Aluminum also acts as a good reflector for certain types of radiation.

7. Blast Doors
	•	Steel alloy blast doors are designed to withstand significant pressure and radiation.
	•	They are often multi-layered, incorporating materials like steel, lead, and sometimes tungsten to ensure they can handle the combined effects of blast and radiation.

8. Air Filtration Systems
	•	HEPA filters and carbon filters are used to remove radioactive particles from the air supply. These are crucial for maintaining breathable air UV after a nuclear event.
	•	Activated charcoal is used to filter out radioactive gases and toxins from the air supply.

9. Earth
	•	Bunkers are often buried several feet underground, using soil and rock as an additional radiation and blast shield. Earth itself is highly effective at absorbing radiation and dissipating shockwaves.

10. Underground Tunnels
	•	Tunnels and internal compartments help dissipate pressure and provide escape routes in case one part of the bunker is compromised.

11. Plumbing and Electrical Systems
	•	Non-conductive materials like PVC for plumbing and copper wire for electrical systems are used to ensure safety. However, all these systems are typically designed to be isolated and shielded from external radiation.

Design Considerations:
	•	Multiple layers: Bunkers are often designed with multiple layers of protection—such as reinforced concrete walls, lead, and steel—each serving a different function in blocking different types of threats (blast, radiation, heat).
	•	Ventilation: A critical system to ensure air circulation without letting radiation in, often with sealed air filters.
	•	Escape routes: These can be constructed from concrete and steel to ensure safe exit in case of structural failure in one part of the bunker. Guys give me stuff to add please.",fAtVPSmMXII

@RKPMLLC,0,"That's a bunch of bullshit. Being able to swim has nothing to do with being black or white. I was in NAVSPECWAR for seven years!! (ST4 & Advanced Training Command Det Little Creek - Fort Story) I swam before the Navy, during my time in the Navy and still do; I grew up with a lot of black kids who swam.  I've met A LOT of WHITE MEN and WOMEN who can't swim. This entire line of thinking about black people and swimming comes from the fact that black people weren't ALLOWED TO SWIM in WHITE SWIMMING POOLS for DECADES! So the notion of us not being able to swim grew and grew. The reason you don't see a lot of black men in SPECIAL FORCES has more to do with EXPOSURE to the opportunity or simply having the desire to do so.  We weren't allowed to be more than cooks in the military for a long time.  When Special Forces units were developed - do you think those WHITE MEN wanted BLACK MEN among those small ranks? No. Why? Racism - it's just that simple. It took a very long time for black men to even WANT TO be a part of SPECIAL FORCES and even then; there were huge obstacles to overcome because of the history of there being predominantly white men in those ranks.  When it comes to ANYTHING ATHLETIC - and I do mean ANYTHING (especially dropping dyck into your wife); black men are far more superior. When it comes to BRAIN POWER - we are just as, if not more capable than anyone else on earth.  I've served with all types of people and trust me.....dumb comes in all colors - physical ability or inability - comes in all colors. When the opportunity presents itself and we have to prove what we are made of; we can do the job. That sergeant - that was his issue. Not all black men.",R-kz3deX1uU

@captaincrunch3720,0,This is why it so important as black people to teach our children how to swim. Our ancestors developed a fear of the water due to the trauma they endured from white supremacist keeping them from the equal opportunity to learn to swim which made it easier to catch them should they escape and be unable to cross a larger body of water. Today a lot of black people still don't know how to swim and that poses a danger to them as many have lost their lives drowning due to a lack of education.,R-kz3deX1uU

@mbarron6760,0,"Cars were an inovative technology created in the 17th century. The French inventor Nicolas-Joseph Cugnot built the first steam-powered road vehicle in 1769, while the Swiss inventor François Isaac de Rivaz designed and constructed the first internal combustion-powered automobile in 1808. The modern car—a practical, marketable automobile for everyday use—was invented in 1886, when the German inventor Carl Benz patented his Benz Patent-Motorwagen. Commercial cars became widely available during the 20th century. The 1901 Oldsmobile Curved Dash and the 1908 Ford Model T, both American cars, are widely considered the first mass-produced and mass-affordable cars, respectively. Cars were rapidly adopted in the US, where they replaced horse-drawn carriages. In Europe and other parts of the world, demand for automobiles did not increase until after World War II. In the 21st century, car usage is still increasing rapidly, especially in China, India, and other newly industrialised countries. 
  Cars have controls for driving, parking, passenger comfort, and a variety of lamps. Over the decades, additional features and controls have been added to vehicles, making them progressively more complex. These include rear-reversing cameras, air conditioning, navigation systems, and in-car entertainment. Most cars in use in the early 2020s are propelled by an internal combustion engine, fueled by the combustion of fossil fuels. Electric cars, which were invented early in the history of the car, became commercially available in the 2000s and are predicted to cost less to buy than petrol-driven cars before 2025. The transition from fossil fuel-powered cars to electric cars features prominently in most climate change mitigation scenarios, such as Project Drawdown's 100 actionable solutions for climate change.
  There are costs and benefits to car use. The costs to the individual include acquiring the vehicle, interest payments (if the car is financed), repairs and maintenance, fuel, depreciation, driving time, parking fees, taxes, and insurance. The costs to society include maintaining roads, land-use, road congestion, air pollution, noise pollution, public health, and disposing of the vehicle at the end of its life. Traffic collisions are the largest cause of injury-related deaths worldwide. Personal benefits include on-demand transportation, mobility, independence, and convenience. Societal benefits include economic benefits, such as job and wealth creation from the automotive industry, transportation provision, societal well-being from leisure and travel opportunities. People's ability to move flexibly from place to place has far-reaching implications for the nature of societies.",nvzKOwtjshg
