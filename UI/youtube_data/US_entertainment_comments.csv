@2020Tech4U,0,"Ok this was me...Sixth grade I missed like 60% of class, my teacher said he lost my grades but he told them he knew I was passing lol Then high school I ditched first period and last period so many times they got dropped, I thought this meant I need not worry about them and I can came late and leave early, well I was wrong, near the end of the year I got caught and was told that I was suppose to show up to detention every morning and last period and not coming to school was not an option... I PASSED!!! lol",bVOPjinxDJM

@JoseAlvarez-pb3sh,0,This was me a lot of teachers don’t want to have kids fail their class so I had a deal with 2 of mine that they marked  me present and I did all my work I had a secondary school for my first three periods and I was in externship. Externship required ten hours a week  so I went for 2 hours and day and 5 th period shit was fire. I won an award at graduation for exemplary school spirit,bVOPjinxDJM
