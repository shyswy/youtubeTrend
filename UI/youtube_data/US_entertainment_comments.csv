@legendthorne2085,0,Nice to see for once people not gettting upset over a cultural or genetic basis for a stereotype which is so because it's actually a thing.

Not wrong to think people with African descent wouldn't have evolved genetically to handle swimming as much as someone say with European descent who's ancestors had to grow accustomed to many Lakes and Rivers to swim.  Sure the Mediterranean people are great swimmers compared to say people from Jungle Climates like South America.,R-kz3deX1uU

@Butterfly.jarsss,1,"If “god” was even real (probably not) I don’t think he would ever be religious and here’s why
1. “God” gave him a disability that didn’t allow him to use both of his arms or legs the same as others
2. Many more people would believe in “god” because they would have real proof of god (not the bible) and that would just make his life more unfair 
(I believe the same for everyone who is disabled, homeless or is just Christian because of their families)

@Sh0ckWolf,1,"Isn't that an unlawful brandishing of a weapon? All the dude did was go up to a house and knocked on the door and was communicating with home owner and the owner ran off to get a gun to harrass someone for doing their job?  🤔

@schadenfreudex3350,1,"This type of reguarded stuff always makes me laugh.

'Oh no, a situation where seconds matter. I am at the point I feel threatened enough and feel my life is endangered to the point I need to brandish a firearm. Please strange person at my door, give me a few minutes while I walk to the safe at the other end of my home, proceed to forget the combination because my adrenaline just dumped and my mind can't focus, finally remember the code but enter it twice incorrectly because my hands are shaking so badly. Great, I now have my pistol. I will now attempt to get the trigger lock off. Oh no, where did the wife put the key. Please strange person at the door, would you continue to wait patiently and not break the door down while I find this key? Great, I have found the key. I will now walk to the minimum legally allowed distance my magazine had to be placed away from my firearm. Please good sir, continue to wait.'",s2Ve3bHoLzc
@H45556,1,"My guess, the “peace out” is how they eventually catch the guy. Like they hear a suspect say it or see him sign something online with it. The line was delivered with way more importance and clarity than was necessary. You only do that if you need the audience to hear and remember it.
