@universal_wisdom3416,10,"After about 3 hours of gameplay I can confirm this is one of the best remakes I’ve ever played. Visually stunning, added ambient noises which makes everything feel so alive and engaging, voice acting of the original game which is golden, some remodels of NPCs which I have zero complaints about, magic and fire are visually enhanced, the oblivion gates look like something straight out of DOOM. I’ve had goosebumps for about an hour straight. So SO good👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼",wFJ3PZuAjK4

@hunterstien4475,2,I’m so disappointed in you Todd Howard and all Dev’s involved ! Every one star review is worth it. When are companies going to stop appeasing the hypersensitive?

@Frantic857,3,"I wasted way too much of my life playing video games, especially the Elder Scrolls series. And I would advise people to do the same as me and hang up the controllers, and by a King James Bible.
It has the most epic stories in it, from the creation of heaven, earth, and God's prize creation the human race, starting with Adam, then Eve being created from the rib of Adam.
+
The reason Adam was God's crowning creation is because he was created in the image of God, with a body, soul, and spirit, where the angels only have body and spirit.
+
The storyline is incredible, with more than 40 holy men, over 4,000 years, chosen by God, to pen what God inspires them to write / record. And yet all books of the KJV bible never contradict each other at any time.
+
It gives you the history of God's chosen people, their epic battles, their ups and downs, and their defiance of the God that not only created them, but tolerated their sin against Him and their following of the enemy of God, one of His angels who chose to rebel, ""a fallen angel"", better know as lucifer or Satan.
+
And eventually a Saviour is born, who comes into the world to save not only a fallen, chosen few, but to save the entire world, or at least those who would believe on Him and what He has done for them, and what He is going to do for them, eternal life!
+
Ending with a crescendo of epic proportions. God created us, protected us, and eventually dies for us, in order that we may have eternal life, with Him in an entirely new heaven and a new earth, and new everlasting bodies.
+
But the final episode is yet to play out. God gave us His final Revelation, as to what ""will"" happen in the end of days, the battles are fierce, the lives lost is in the billions, the earth will be scorched and land will be displaced as never has been seen since the creation.

@universal_wisdom3416,1,"I went into this thinking it would be Oblivion with new textures. But it’s actually so much more. I’m pretty sure they REMADE some pieces of the music, the ambient sounds especially at night are awe inspiring, I took a clip of the music kicking in as the moonlight casts over Skingrad Castle and a wolf howled in the distance… goosebumps all over my body. Combat feels so much better than the original. All the funny oblivion moments are still there, but they don’t seem like glitches at all. It feels like a new game even though I know it’s not.

@athanotitanathas8582,1,"Yes I’m aware of how long this is, it’s mainly for the developers too read. So if your brain has an issue with reading for more then 15 secs no one really cares or needs to hear about it so simply just don’t read and move on. Now if you care about the health of this game all are more then welcome too read and leave meaningful opinions as I will not entertain any fools so you’ll just be wasting your time if you have anything moronic too add. Now with that being said.

Your not kidding about losing people honestly surprised supercell is releasing a new game when squad busters legit just came out not long ago definitely not gonna help and games already doing rough. I actually really like this game mainly because I can see how much potential the concept has but it I were to give an overall rating based on the game as a whole it be 2 out of 5. Main complaint is there just simply is very poor balance on the characters miner, ruffs, archer queen, and even barb king still after nerf are way too OP compared too the rest this needs too be addressed ASAP or you will lose more players guaranteed. I can see your at least trying to add a bit of variety but reusing and slightly modifying the same events just isn’t enough to cut it tbh I had a thought for a new co op mode that I would call BIG! BAD!! BOSS!!! you would have to team up to take out a full on boss with multiple attacks a rage mode when damaged that adds an ultimate attack with the goal being simply to work together too defeat the boss within the time limit then there could be a boss specific to each area in the game with the bosses gets more difficult with the later areas. Resources are overflowing with not much to spend on that makes a real difference in the long run especially style tickets I think a good fix for this would be too make more detailed skins with emotes like you did with Easter mavis then charge 1200 tickets instead for the higher quality and just simply make more skins and have them available for ticket purchase earlier. Really don’t want to see this game die out I truly believe this could become one of the greats, but unless you all take steps in the right direction soon future for the game isn’t looking great as of this moment. Wishing all the developers the best I know it’s not easy and you all are likely trying your best these are just some friendly suggestions thanks for taking the time too read have a nice day! ✌️😎",x-spEnJJSeQ

@Pitt.2021,8,"Regardless of our religious backgrounds, I believe we can all recognize that Pope Francis served the Church, humanity, and God with profound love, humility, and unwavering dedication. His life was a powerful testament to compassion, faith, and selfless service.

To those who may not share the Catholic faith, I ask only for the same respect we each desire for our own beliefs. Mocking what we do not understand only deepens division and pulls us away from the love and unity that Christ calls us to. From the very beginning, His message has been simple and powerful: love one another, and extend grace and respect across all differences.

Yes, they can become elevated in businesses. In matters outside of pastoral leadership, but that is it that is all it will ever be this idea of trying to westernize God‘s church is disrespectful to the will of God, and the most dangerous thing are non-Catholic speaking about Catholicism and ignorant Catholics speaking about Catholic tradition. Both are very dangerous because it confuses people and misleads people. The Catholic Church is not an American institution stop trying to Westernize it with speaking of race and gender Black people worldwide are not the same as black Americans they are not looked at the same. They are not regarded the same. They are not treated the same outside of this country and this ridiculous kangaroo media organization. The rest of the world does not see race and color the way that media does, outside of America and American media people of different races different skin colors are just different people.

The Pope was definitely not repping the Biblical scriptures that any believer can access for themselves. No idols, no graven images, do not pray in repetition, do not pray in crowds for people to see, no other Gods before me. Jesus said pray to the Father no other Saint or representative needed nor can they answer prayers. Jesus is the only way to the Father and the Pope brought other religions together saying we are equal. Yeah if any one actually looked into Catholic Doctrines and matched them with scripture I believe they would see there’s something wrong with this faith.

This a perfect continuation, if you will, of Cleet's video from Friday. In fact I had so much fun watching this I went back and rewatched the Dale jr and Cleet interview. 
I wonder if George let something out of the bag, or he was just dreaming. Are we watching the beginning of something GREAT in the world of motor sports. Dale jr, with ""Mr THE Biff"" and RedZone Racing all helping out, joining forces to perhaps create something AWESOME. DARE To DREAM.

@EdmurPortuga,0,"Danish Officials Question the Source of the Bodies
Morten Messerschmidt, Danish MP (Member of Parliament) and chairman of the People’s Party (Dansk Folkeparti) was shocked by the exhibition. On February 7, he asked the Minister of Health several questions about the law, ethics and China’s use of political prisoners’ organs:


Morten Messerschmidt, MP and chairman of the People’s Party, asked the Minister of Health questions about ethical issues regarding the body exhibition.

Question 275: “Can you explain what permits and legal procedures are required for the exhibition of human remains in Denmark and whether the exhibition of human remains complies with applicable laws?”

Question 276: “Can the Minister explain how the use of human remains in exhibitions should ensure the consent of the deceased or their relatives? “

Question 277: “Will the Minister comment on the ethical considerations in connection with the commercial use of human bodies in exhibitions such as Human-Bodies, including whether the current rules are sufficient, or whether there should be stricter rules for such exhibitions in Denmark?”

Question No. 278: “Will the Minister investigate whether he is aware of similar exhibitions of human bodies internationally that are related to lack of consent or illegal trade, and whether the Minister will investigate human bodies in this regard? In this context, is the Minister aware of China’s use of organs from political prisoners?”

Søren Espersen, a senior member of the Danish Democratic Party (Danmarksdemokraterne) and chairman of the Religious Committee, asked the Minister of Culture on February 19: “Can it be determined with certainty that all bodies and body parts are donated voluntarily, do not originate from, for example, executed prisoners in dictatorships, or originate from illegal organ trafficking?”


Søren Espersen, a senior member of the Danish Democratic Party, asked the Minister of Culture about the bodies.

“The exhibition has been criticized in several places because of doubts that the bodies were not all donated voluntarily and for a clear purpose,” Thomas Krarup, director of health, culture and care in the city of Randers, wrote in a notification to government authorities.",3fy-Seli0Jc

[4]-In whom the god of this world hath blinded the minds of them which believe not, lest the light of the glorious gospel of Christ, who is the image of God, should shine unto them.)

(Romans 10:9-10 > [9]-That if thou shalt confess with thy mouth the Lord Jesus, and shalt believe in thine heart that God hath raised him from the dead, thou shalt be saved.
[10]-For with the heart man believeth unto righteousness; and with the mouth confession is made unto salvation.)

(Romans 10:13 > For whosoever shall call upon the name of the Lord shall be saved.)

(Ephesians 2:8-9 > [8]-For by grace are ye saved through faith; and that not of yourselves: it is the gift of God:
[9]-Not of works, lest any man should boast.)

(Revelation 3:20 > Behold, I stand at the door, and knock: if any man hear my voice, and open the door, I will come in to him, and sup with him, and he with me.)

Is Jesus knocking at the door of your heart?
Is this your opportunity for eternal salvation?
If it is, I hope and pray that you open the door and invite Him, (Jesus), into your heart and life, in Jesus' name. Amen!

@violet3464,2,"This stuff is one of the things i don't really like. It isn't typical for Monster Hunter. Yea it is nice, but idk not really a fan of those limited time events. Prefer more the classic MH way to just download event quest and can play them whenever I want. It also takes way to long for new content if I think about Rise where we got 5 Monsters with one update.

Sorry, new Monster to hunt is better than this. I spend only time in the hub to select a quest and that's it",-F33ACcPbhU

@just.Harley,1,"I've been keeping up with quadeca since voice memos, which I when I noticed how different quadeca is. He was always the type to get the extra mile in his music, and the emotional themes he tackled hit close to home for me. Since then, I've been listening to Quadeca improve and change overtime. As time passes, it seems the themes of his music only get more personal to myself. The way he's went from being a people pleaser and someone who cares about how other people think way too much, to then suicidal ideation and the satisfying and entrancing thought of floating away into nothingness... then seemingly dealing with those feelings with the idea of fleeing, vanishing without a trace. I'm only a little younger than Quadeca, and the way my life transitions, I feel I relate to many of the feelings Quadeca shares in his albums. I'm happy I'm able to witness Quadeca's journey, I feel it's helped me deal with the many emotional complexities by losing myself in music that understands and respects those same complexities.

Let's be honest here, pope Francis did not allow homosexuality because that's a sin as Jesus' Catholic Church teaches but he taught us to welcome every one as Jesus did and bless them, those blessings help all of us sinners including homosexuals and transgenderism etc.. to transform into Christ like beings as God created us to be.
