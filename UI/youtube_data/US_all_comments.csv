@athanotitanathas8582,1,"Yes I’m aware of how long this is, it’s mainly for the developers too read. So if your brain has an issue with reading for more then 15 secs no one really cares or needs to hear about it so simply just don’t read and move on. Now if you care about the health of this game all are more then welcome too read and leave meaningful opinions as I will not entertain any fools so you’ll just be wasting your time if you have anything moronic too add. Now with that being said.

Your not kidding about losing people honestly surprised supercell is releasing a new game when squad busters legit just came out not long ago definitely not gonna help and games already doing rough. I actually really like this game mainly because I can see how much potential the concept has but it I were to give an overall rating based on the game as a whole it be 2 out of 5. Main complaint is there just simply is very poor balance on the characters miner, ruffs, archer queen, and even barb king still after nerf are way too OP compared too the rest this needs too be addressed ASAP or you will lose more players guaranteed. I can see your at least trying to add a bit of variety but reusing and slightly modifying the same events just isn’t enough to cut it tbh I had a thought for a new co op mode that I would call BIG! BAD!! BOSS!!! you would have to team up to take out a full on boss with multiple attacks a rage mode when damaged that adds an ultimate attack with the goal being simply to work together too defeat the boss within the time limit then there could be a boss specific to each area in the game with the bosses gets more difficult with the later areas. Resources are overflowing with not much to spend on that makes a real difference in the long run especially style tickets I think a good fix for this would be too make more detailed skins with emotes like you did with Easter mavis then charge 1200 tickets instead for the higher quality and just simply make more skins and have them available for ticket purchase earlier. Really don’t want to see this game die out I truly believe this could become one of the greats, but unless you all take steps in the right direction soon future for the game isn’t looking great as of this moment. Wishing all the developers the best I know it’s not easy and you all are likely trying your best these are just some friendly suggestions thanks for taking the time too read have a nice day! ✌️😎",x-spEnJJSeQ

Yes, they can become elevated in businesses. In matters outside of pastoral leadership, but that is it that is all it will ever be this idea of trying to westernize God‘s church is disrespectful to the will of God, and the most dangerous thing are non-Catholic speaking about Catholicism and ignorant Catholics speaking about Catholic tradition. Both are very dangerous because it confuses people and misleads people. The Catholic Church is not an American institution stop trying to Westernize it with speaking of race and gender Black people worldwide are not the same as black Americans they are not looked at the same. They are not regarded the same. They are not treated the same outside of this country and this ridiculous kangaroo media organization. The rest of the world does not see race and color the way that media does, outside of America and American media people of different races different skin colors are just different people. They are still looked at as equal human beings just different. The skin color is regarded in the same fashion as somebody’s hair color.

@BigSplashInteractive,1,"Umm I’m not sure but Christ was the representative of God on the earth. The Pope was definitely not repping the Biblical scriptures that any believer can access for themselves. No idols, no graven images, do not pray in repetition, do not pray in crowds for people to see, no other Gods before me. Jesus said pray to the Father no other Saint or representative needed nor can they answer prayers. Jesus is the only way to the Father and the Pope brought other religions together saying we are equal. Yeah if any one actually looked into Catholic Doctrines and matched them with scripture I believe they would see there’s something wrong with this faith.

@simpforsable,1,"My perspective from Germany is, that it is actually quite difficult to see movies in English here, and German dubs are horrible. So I'll often wait for a release on streaming and even then sometimes you can only buy/rent/stream German versions for some reason, or it lands on something like HULU or peacock which doesn't have a German distributor or is very niche, so that no one is subscribed. Also if the movie takes too long to move from theatre to streaming I might straight up forget about it, because shows and adverts and podcasts about movies will only remind you of the theatrical reals, not the streaming release later.",I0Jwv40MkiY

Up til then i would regularly watch a movie, sometimes random, and just enjoy my time.. but i've just stopped.   It's just a different landscape, i have other things that pull my attention, on top of of my limited ""free time"", i don't usually watch movies anymore.. and it sucks.  I also worked at a movie theater part time with other jobs for many years, and was in the midst of all the change from stadium seating, to new food options, to discount tuesdays, to movie theater subscriptions.  I've been away awhile and even i can see the clear difference it ""feels"" like in the industry at this point.  What's going to happen?   No idea, but like every one else, i hope smaller original movies get there market somewhere other than dying on VUDU or Shutter or TUBI.  :(",I0Jwv40MkiY
@ZealousTots,1,"It’s not just cost or crowds - free time is a big factor as well. 

I remember leaving Novocaine thinking about how much of a time suck going to the movies is. 


Between the half-hour drive to the theater, the 25 minutes of trailers, a two hour movie, followed by the same thirty minute drive back home - about three and a half hours of my day just dedicated to a forgettable streaming-tier movie. 

At this point, I don’t even want to go anymore unless it got truly stellar reviews and it’s from people I trust. 

So I guess thanks Novocaine for making me reassess my movie-going habits.",I0Jwv40MkiY

@EdmurPortuga,0,"Danish Officials Question the Source of the Bodies
Morten Messerschmidt, Danish MP (Member of Parliament) and chairman of the People’s Party (Dansk Folkeparti) was shocked by the exhibition. On February 7, he asked the Minister of Health several questions about the law, ethics and China’s use of political prisoners’ organs:


Morten Messerschmidt, MP and chairman of the People’s Party, asked the Minister of Health questions about ethical issues regarding the body exhibition.

Question 275: “Can you explain what permits and legal procedures are required for the exhibition of human remains in Denmark and whether the exhibition of human remains complies with applicable laws?”

Question 276: “Can the Minister explain how the use of human remains in exhibitions should ensure the consent of the deceased or their relatives? “

Question 277: “Will the Minister comment on the ethical considerations in connection with the commercial use of human bodies in exhibitions such as Human-Bodies, including whether the current rules are sufficient, or whether there should be stricter rules for such exhibitions in Denmark?”

Question No. 278: “Will the Minister investigate whether he is aware of similar exhibitions of human bodies internationally that are related to lack of consent or illegal trade, and whether the Minister will investigate human bodies in this regard? In this context, is the Minister aware of China’s use of organs from political prisoners?”

Søren Espersen, a senior member of the Danish Democratic Party (Danmarksdemokraterne) and chairman of the Religious Committee, asked the Minister of Culture on February 19: “Can it be determined with certainty that all bodies and body parts are donated voluntarily, do not originate from, for example, executed prisoners in dictatorships, or originate from illegal organ trafficking?”


Søren Espersen, a senior member of the Danish Democratic Party, asked the Minister of Culture about the bodies.

“The exhibition has been criticized in several places because of doubts that the bodies were not all donated voluntarily and for a clear purpose,” Thomas Krarup, director of health, culture and care in the city of Randers, wrote in a notification to government authorities.",3fy-Seli0Jc

Satan is referred to as the prince of the power of the air for good reason, he owns the airwaves on planet earth and is the god (little g) of this world. It is my hope and prayer that you choose the God (Big G) of heaven who controls the destiny of your eternal soul.

(2 Corinthians 4:3-4 > [3]-But if our gospel be hid, it is hid to them that are lost:
[4]-In whom the god of this world hath blinded the minds of them which believe not, lest the light of the glorious gospel of Christ, who is the image of God, should shine unto them.)

(Romans 10:9-10 > [9]-That if thou shalt confess with thy mouth the Lord Jesus, and shalt believe in thine heart that God hath raised him from the dead, thou shalt be saved.
[10]-For with the heart man believeth unto righteousness; and with the mouth confession is made unto salvation.)

(Romans 10:13 > For whosoever shall call upon the name of the Lord shall be saved.)

(Ephesians 2:8-9 > [8]-For by grace are ye saved through faith; and that not of yourselves: it is the gift of God:
[9]-Not of works, lest any man should boast.)

(Revelation 3:20 > Behold, I stand at the door, and knock: if any man hear my voice, and open the door, I will come in to him, and sup with him, and he with me.)

Is Jesus knocking at the door of your heart?
Is this your opportunity for eternal salvation?
If it is, I hope and pray that you open the door and invite Him, (Jesus), into your heart and life, in Jesus' name. Amen!

You’re gonna lose your kids to Michael because Carly‘s gonna make sure of it and I’m gonna laugh ha ha ha if you really cared about Michael, you would just leave well enough alone just leave My alone Willow you cold hearted person.

Jesus, HIS relationship with the girl is WHAT drew people IN. 

Without that, its just zombie fighting with a vendetta between girl bosses wannabes... great, riveting! 

Thank you HBO for ruining the series for me! I dont care if thats what they did in the stupid game, YOU can do WHATEVER u want!

@just.Harley,1,"I've been keeping up with quadeca since voice memos, which I when I noticed how different quadeca is. He was always the type to get the extra mile in his music, and the emotional themes he tackled hit close to home for me. Since then, I've been listening to Quadeca improve and change overtime. As time passes, it seems the themes of his music only get more personal to myself. The way he's went from being a people pleaser and someone who cares about how other people think way too much, to then suicidal ideation and the satisfying and entrancing thought of floating away into nothingness... then seemingly dealing with those feelings with the idea of fleeing, vanishing without a trace. I'm only a little younger than Quadeca, and the way my life transitions, I feel I relate to many of the feelings Quadeca shares in his albums. I'm happy I'm able to witness Quadeca's journey, I feel it's helped me deal with the many emotional complexities by losing myself in music that understands and respects those same complexities.

@Hooptedoodle,0,"9:34 fun fact ICEEs (polar bear mascot) and Slush Puppies (white dog mascot) are two completely different brands of slush. Both are of the slush/slushy category but are distinctly different, though the names are probably used generically in different places. ICEEs are non-newtonian chemically slush (not knocking it that's just what it is) and Slush Puppies the original slush and are harder to find (at least by me) and are basically just really dense snow-cone ice that's super-saturated in snow-cone syrup. thanks for attending my Ted talk on slushies.",3XyDEMolFAU

It took a toll on her)with the help of her members and time she was able to rediscover who she is. while it may close a door during the process new possibilities awaits her where ever the ocean flow.
