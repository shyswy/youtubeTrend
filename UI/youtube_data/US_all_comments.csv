@yuijghju,0,"Mainstream Media: The Source of the Body Exhibition Specimens Is Not Known
On February 28, the Danish newspaper Christian Daily carried an article titled, “Dead bodies are on display in Danish cities. No one can answer where they come from” on the front page of the newspaper and the website. The article said there were questions about where the corpses came from.


Danish newspaper Christian Daily carried an article questioning the source of the bodies.

It stated that Falun Gong, a religious group from China, has been persecuted in China for 25 years. The group has a lot of evidence to prove that thousands of Falun Gong practitioners have been detained in the CCP’s prisons for adhering to their beliefs, and a large number of practitioners have been tortured. In 2006, it was discovered that many practitioners had their organs harvested [while they were] alive and trafficked. Many Danish people said they were worried that these human specimens on display were from Chinese prisoners.

People Sign the Petition to Oppose the CCP’s Forced Organ Harvesting



People sign the petition to condemn the CCP’s forced organ harvesting.

On February 22, a woman in Horsens said, “I feel bad. These dead people have no dignity. They are treated like animals by the butchers. They have no identity, no age, no proof, no statement of their wishes before death, or whether they agree to their bodies being exhibited.”

After a young man signed the petition from the Doctors Against Forced Organ Harvesting (DAFOH). He said, “My mother just saw the exhibition and took your materials home. After reading the materials carefully, she was shocked and asked me to sign for her. I hope to do my part to support Falun Dafa practitioners’ just actions against the persecution and against organ harvesting.”

On March 2 in the port city of Frederikshavn, two female doctors working in a hospital saw the problems of the body exhibition clearly with their professional expertise. One said, “As a doctor, I understand the structure of the human body and can see that some of the human specimens have traces of injuries on the bones, indicating that the deceased may have been tortured. Moreover, these corpses are not marked with their source, age, cause of death, purpose of the donor, and other detailed information.

“From these two points I see, I know what you said is true. These human specimens are questionable.”

They talked to Falun Gong practitioners who came to the body exhibition to raise awareness of human rights persecution in China and said, “We understand your concerns and support your righteous actions.” They signed the DAFOH petition to support the effort to expose forced organ harvesting.

At noon, four middle-aged people drove to the exhibition. A practitioner told them, “The exhibition organizer did not show evidence of where these bodies came from. The CCP is currently persecuting Falun Gong and other dissidents, and removing their organs while they are alive for huge profits. These corpse specimens all look like Asians. They are likely to be prisoners of conscience in China, suffering cruel persecution by the CCP’s dictatorship.”

After they quietly listened, they took the materials and walked into the exhibition hall. But they soon came out.

One of them said, “We changed our minds and decided not to buy tickets to see the exhibition. We do not support such an exhibition.” They signed the petition and thanked practitioners.

A couple came out of the exhibition hall and were about to get in their car, when a practitioner told them that the human specimens might be from prisoners of conscience in China, and their organs might have been harvested alive. They were shocked. The woman’s eyes filled with tears and the couple signed the petition.

After seeing the exhibition, many people signed the petition. Some said, “What you said is true. I support you in exposing the persecution and the organ harvesting.” People talked with practitioners for a long time, and said they wanted to know more about the persecution.

Many people asked what they could do to help. A practitioner said, “Your signature is a support for us. You can tell your friends and relatives that the CCP persecutes Falun Gong practitioners and other innocent people, and harvests human organs on a large scale and in an organized manner to make huge profits. The bodies in this exhibition might be from prisoners of conscience in China. Let more people know the truth, and we can stop the persecution in China as soon as possible.”

People were deeply concerned by the cruel human rights violations. Some people suggested that citizens should call for legislation in Denmark so that such controversial exhibitions can be prevented from being held in Denmark in the future.",wFJ3PZuAjK4

As a long-time fan from South Korea, I was deeply excited to hear the news of Oblivion Remastered—until I found out that it’s not available in my region.

This decision is extremely disappointing. Korea has a dedicated Elder Scrolls fanbase that has supported your titles for decades. Blocking access without any official explanation feels like a blatant disregard for your global audience.

We deserve transparency, and more importantly, equal access. Please lift the region lock or provide a clear reason for this exclusion. Don’t let Korean fans be left behind—again.",kk5cymSWmqo

@yuijghju,0,"Mainstream Media: The Source of the Body Exhibition Specimens Is Not Known
On February 28, the Danish newspaper Christian Daily carried an article titled, “Dead bodies are on display in Danish cities. No one can answer where they come from” on the front page of the newspaper and the website. The article said there were questions about where the corpses came from.


Danish newspaper Christian Daily carried an article questioning the source of the bodies.

It stated that Falun Gong, a religious group from China, has been persecuted in China for 25 years. The group has a lot of evidence to prove that thousands of Falun Gong practitioners have been detained in the CCP’s prisons for adhering to their beliefs, and a large number of practitioners have been tortured. In 2006, it was discovered that many practitioners had their organs harvested [while they were] alive and trafficked. Many Danish people said they were worried that these human specimens on display were from Chinese prisoners.

People Sign the Petition to Oppose the CCP’s Forced Organ Harvesting



People sign the petition to condemn the CCP’s forced organ harvesting.

On February 22, a woman in Horsens said, “I feel bad. These dead people have no dignity. They are treated like animals by the butchers. They have no identity, no age, no proof, no statement of their wishes before death, or whether they agree to their bodies being exhibited.”

After a young man signed the petition from the Doctors Against Forced Organ Harvesting (DAFOH). He said, “My mother just saw the exhibition and took your materials home. After reading the materials carefully, she was shocked and asked me to sign for her. I hope to do my part to support Falun Dafa practitioners’ just actions against the persecution and against organ harvesting.”

On March 2 in the port city of Frederikshavn, two female doctors working in a hospital saw the problems of the body exhibition clearly with their professional expertise. One said, “As a doctor, I understand the structure of the human body and can see that some of the human specimens have traces of injuries on the bones, indicating that the deceased may have been tortured. Moreover, these corpses are not marked with their source, age, cause of death, purpose of the donor, and other detailed information.

“From these two points I see, I know what you said is true. These human specimens are questionable.”

They talked to Falun Gong practitioners who came to the body exhibition to raise awareness of human rights persecution in China and said, “We understand your concerns and support your righteous actions.” They signed the DAFOH petition to support the effort to expose forced organ harvesting.

At noon, four middle-aged people drove to the exhibition. A practitioner told them, “The exhibition organizer did not show evidence of where these bodies came from. The CCP is currently persecuting Falun Gong and other dissidents, and removing their organs while they are alive for huge profits. These corpse specimens all look like Asians. They are likely to be prisoners of conscience in China, suffering cruel persecution by the CCP’s dictatorship.”

After they quietly listened, they took the materials and walked into the exhibition hall. But they soon came out.

One of them said, “We changed our minds and decided not to buy tickets to see the exhibition. We do not support such an exhibition.” They signed the petition and thanked practitioners.

A couple came out of the exhibition hall and were about to get in their car, when a practitioner told them that the human specimens might be from prisoners of conscience in China, and their organs might have been harvested alive. They were shocked. The woman’s eyes filled with tears and the couple signed the petition.

After seeing the exhibition, many people signed the petition. Some said, “What you said is true. I support you in exposing the persecution and the organ harvesting.” People talked with practitioners for a long time, and said they wanted to know more about the persecution.

Many people asked what they could do to help. A practitioner said, “Your signature is a support for us. You can tell your friends and relatives that the CCP persecutes Falun Gong practitioners and other innocent people, and harvests human organs on a large scale and in an organized manner to make huge profits. The bodies in this exhibition might be from prisoners of conscience in China. Let more people know the truth, and we can stop the persecution in China as soon as possible.”

People were deeply concerned by the cruel human rights violations. Some people suggested that citizens should call for legislation in Denmark so that such controversial exhibitions can be prevented from being held in Denmark in the future.",kk5cymSWmqo

- In my opinion the game should be extremely scary (Thalassophobia ) 
- different vehicles that have different advantages and disadvantages
- Lots of different leviathans with different behavior patterns. (In my opinion you should not be able to kill them)
- AI of the Leviatahn should be better 
- The story should not be told but explored 
- The map should be explored in stages like in Hollow knight (need a special upgrade to survive in a biome or to dive deeper)
- For multiplayer a ship that has to be controlled by several people at the same time

I have more but that would go beyond the scope",i8oqrucfXQo
@iesty,1,"saw someone else say something like this - exploration should be non-linear and encouraged but not streamlined, like how you knew you needed to find all of the precursor bases in the original subnautica but not where they were.

@yuijghju,0,"Former Member of House of Representatives: Justice Will Prevail

Hirosato Nakatugawa, former member of the House of Representatives

For many years, the issue of forced organ harvesting in China was unknown in Japan. Former member of the House of Representatives, Mr. Hirosato Nakatsugawa has been working on this issue for 20 years and was the first person to take action in the Japanese Parliament. He worked with David Kilgour, former Canadian MP, and human rights lawyer David Matas to continue the investigations and information dissemination.

Due to Japan’s economic relationship with China, it’s very difficult to discuss the issue of forced organ harvesting publicly, and the media seldom reports on it. However, in recent years, Japan’s Sankei Shimbun newspaper and certain TV programs began paying attention to this issue, so the public is becoming increasingly aware of the situation.

Mr. Nakatsugawa called on the people of Shibuya and Yokohama to pay attention to the seriousness of the issue of forced organ harvesting. He warned that children’s organs may also be harvested in China, and this problem may become more serious in the future.

Mr. Nakatsugawa appealed to the Japanese government, calling for the adoption of a resolution criticizing China, and the enactment of a law to protect Falun Gong practitioners. He firmly believes that justice will prevail and said he will continue to work hard to solve the problem of forced organ harvesting.",9QABNfDhSxs

@yuijghju,0,"Former Member of House of Representatives: Justice Will Prevail

Hirosato Nakatugawa, former member of the House of Representatives

For many years, the issue of forced organ harvesting in China was unknown in Japan. Former member of the House of Representatives, Mr. Hirosato Nakatsugawa has been working on this issue for 20 years and was the first person to take action in the Japanese Parliament. He worked with David Kilgour, former Canadian MP, and human rights lawyer David Matas to continue the investigations and information dissemination.

Due to Japan’s economic relationship with China, it’s very difficult to discuss the issue of forced organ harvesting publicly, and the media seldom reports on it. However, in recent years, Japan’s Sankei Shimbun newspaper and certain TV programs began paying attention to this issue, so the public is becoming increasingly aware of the situation.

Mr. Nakatsugawa called on the people of Shibuya and Yokohama to pay attention to the seriousness of the issue of forced organ harvesting. He warned that children’s organs may also be harvested in China, and this problem may become more serious in the future.

Mr. Nakatsugawa appealed to the Japanese government, calling for the adoption of a resolution criticizing China, and the enactment of a law to protect Falun Gong practitioners. He firmly believes that justice will prevail and said he will continue to work hard to solve the problem of forced organ harvesting.",cHKwNuQ2vYE

@Frantic857,1,"I wasted way too much of my life playing video games, especially the Elder Scrolls series. And I would advise people to do the same as me and hang up the controllers, and by a King James Bible.
It has the most epic stories in it, from the creation of heaven, earth, and God's prize creation the human race, starting with Adam, then Eve being created from the rib of Adam.
+
The reason Adam was God's crowning creation is because he was created in the image of God, with a body, soul, and spirit, where the angels only have body and spirit.
+
The storyline is incredible, with more than 40 holy men, over 4,000 years, chosen by God, to pen what God inspires them to write / record. And yet all books of the KJV bible never contradict each other at any time.
+
It gives you the history of God's chosen people, their epic battles, their ups and downs, and their defiance of the God that not only created them, but tolerated their sin against Him and their following of the enemy of God, one of His angels who chose to rebel, ""a fallen angel"", better know as lucifer or Satan.
+
And eventually a Saviour is born, who comes into the world to save not only a fallen, chosen few, but to save the entire world, or at least those who would believe on Him and what He has done for them, and what He is going to do for them, eternal life!
+
Ending with a crescendo of epic proportions. God created us, protected us, and eventually dies for us, in order that we may have eternal life, with Him in an entirely new heaven and a new earth, and new everlasting bodies.
+
But the final episode is yet to play out. God gave us His final Revelation, as to what ""will"" happen in the end of days, the battles are fierce, the lives lost is in the billions, the earth will be scorched and land will be displaced as never has been seen since the creation.
+
What I have given here is just a snapshot of the greatest Book that has ever been written, The King James Bible. Do you check it out? or do you just keep playing in Satan's playground and wasting your life away, the choice is yours, choose wisely!",rOySakaGuZs
@yuijghju,0,"Human Rights Lawyer David Matas

Mr. David Matas addresses the audience at the film screening.

After Mr. Matas’s presentation, some audience members asked what could be done to stop the forced organ harvesting. Mr. Matas responded that medical technology was developed to improve people’s health and living standards, but in China it has been abused and used as a tool for large-scale human rights violations and mass killings. He emphasized that in response to this problem, the medical industry and people from all walks of life have begun to take action.

New legislation has been requested in Japan to ban organ transplant tourism, and many people have contributed by spreading information about the atrocities in China. The film screening emphasized that it is important not to be indifferent to the problem of forced organ harvesting, and everyone should do what they can. It was brought up that it’s crucial that more people pay attention to the issue and take action to promote a resolution to the problem through information dissemination and signature collection campaigns.

The CCP’s forced organ harvesting was first revealed by witnesses who fled China, and investigations were carried based on their testimonies. Several films have been produced to expose these egregious human rights violations. Although there are few witnesses and evidence is difficult to obtain, many people have put forth great effort to make sure that this issue is not forgotten.


Mr. David Matas

During the film and ensuing discussion, it was made clear that the issue of forced organ harvesting in China is an organized crime in which the state participates, targeting prisoners of conscience—mainly Falun Gong practitioners. The international community has expressed serious concern about what is happening in China.

The testimonies of Falun Gong practitioners play an important role in exposing forced organ harvesting. The testimonies indicate that Falun Gong practitioners underwent blood tests in prison, and many practitioners have simply disappeared. This organ transplant compatibility testing is ongoing, and Falun Gong practitioners’ biodata is included in a massive databank. Those who are selected as organ donors are killed as part of the process of organ transplantation.",rOySakaGuZs

@libertasaeterna5365,3,"I am sand hauler (company driver) in the permian. Everything he said is true and worse!! What appealed to me about the oilfield was the 21/7 schedule that allows me to see my pregnant girlfriend more often. I came from OTR making a consistent 1300-1500 a week. But the pay in sand hauling can vary   wildly. Our company wants 2 loads a day, which on paper doesn't seem that hard but it's the bottlenecks that can happen during those loads. The sand plant is constantly going down, or something may happen at the well. I've sat for 6 hours before waiting on sand, then get to the well, and had to wait another 5 hours because the frac went down. I have pulled 21 hour days just to get two loads in. On a good week, I can make 1300-1700. That's nothing going wrong and a consistent 2 loads a day.on a bad week, I've had $600 checks. I love that 7 days off though, if we were compensated even a bare minimum for the sitting time it would make the industry better. I can tell you trucking can save lives. As long as your license isn't fucked up you can go from being homeless and as long as you keep your bills low you can pull yourself out of a dark place.

@technoutopia4687,1,"This is my response to one of the Walmart YouTubers who lie about how good the job is to get people to use his referral number so he can get $5000.
You can make more money being a yard driver. You’d have to work 2 days of OT though. For the amount of time Walmart drivers spend in the truck they don’t even make $26 an hour. Yard drivers make $30 plus $15 for OT. And they get to go home every night. This guy is just trying to get people to use him as a referral so he can get $5000 from each person that passes onboarding. You don’t need to use him. They are hiring like crazy right now because they are getting rid of all the dedicated Swift drivers. Imagine spending 240 (24 hrs * 5 days * 2 weeks) hours a week in a truck and making less than $11. Yeah you get payed $40 for a 10 hour layover haha that’s only $4 an hour to sleep in a truck and not be at home with your family. If you’re old and you didn’t put anything into your 401k then yes this is the job for you. It’s better than being a door greeter at Walmart. If you’re social, young and physical then it’s not. This Walmart driver is hoping you’d use him as a referral and hopefully you’d pass onboarding so he can make the $5000 of you. If you want to be a driver and make $$$ work for UPS. The UPS drivers can earn up to $175000 a year and they are UNION, this poor guy can even say that word without fear of getting fired. When Trump gets rid of taxes on overtime UPS drivers will double what Walmart drivers make because Walmart drivers get payed 0.64 cents a mile, so sad. Sir, I salute you for your stupidity. You worked 20+ years, 120 hours a week and bringing home less than 3 grand…all while working in California🫡

I was a yard driver then did the A2D program that taught me the very basics of trucking. Basically how to do the pretrip and how to back up in between 2 trailers. Just enough to pass Walmart’s onboarding. Then I was driving with a different CDTs for 12 weeks. Most of the CDTs are drivers that just don’t want to drive anymore but want to get payed. Half the time they were asleep when I was driving. Then I was on my own for 3 months. I was making around $370 to $510 a day because I’d only take 1 or 2 breaks a day. I quit Walmart after doing the math and realizing I’m making so much less than I was before. Walmart door greeters are making more than the drivers. I heard how much UPS drivers were making and quit after talking over with my wife. She couldn’t be any happier. What a way to waste your life driving for Walmart. If you’re in a Walmart truck you are at work so you are working 120 in 5 days. You get payed every 2 weeks so that’s 240 hours of work for around $2800 a paycheck. Do the math…that’s $11 an hour. UPS have Union to make sure drivers are not getting screwed like the Walmart drivers are. Walmarts medical is a joke by the way. You can ask any employee that. If you’re thinking about joining the Walmart fleet just ask any Walmart driver how many hours a week are you away from your family for a paycheck…hopefully they’re smart enough to do the math and reply with 240 hours…some work 6 days and are off 2 or 3. This guy is off 5 days so he’s not even making $100000 a year and he lives in California, imagine that. Explains why he’s constantly begging total strangers to use him as a referral. I’ve actually never seen or heard of another company driver do that.",yIZRffLA294
@technoutopia4687,1,I quit Walmart 3 months ago and now work at UPS. I watch these videos and feel relieved that I didn’t waste 20+ years. Walmart warehouse workers average pay is at $26 and they actually get to be with their families every night and have 3 to 4 days off. I did the associate to driver (A2D) and during my 3 month training they dropped my pay from $28 to $26 an hour. The CDTs (trainers) were mostly ex Walmart drivers who got tired of driving and the BS and decided to take a pay cut to train store and warehouse workers to drive trucks. I remember asking them if they’d ever go back to Walmart driving and they told me “I’d never drive for the Golden Butthole again”. Most of them slept while I was driving. Why are so many Walmart YouTubers push out so many videos promoting how Walmart driving is so easy and great then?? Simple answer is because Walmart drivers will get a $5000 bonus for any person that uses their name and passes onboarding. They also have to stay with the company for a year after getting hired. Walmart is hiring like crazy right now because so many drivers are leaving and finding better jobs. The A2D associates are crashing or too afraid to drive in places like Wyoming so they are returning back to the stores and warehouses. You have a camera in your truck that will record and listen to you if you stop to hard or go over 10 mph over the speed limit. You have to pay for any ticket you get and you will get a “step”. 4 steps and you’re fired. If they give you a load to a dangerous place like Wyoming (watch Wyoming trucking) and you refuse this load you will get a step. Most of the drivers that are sticking around are old that have ADPs at around $500 and have set runs. Meaning they go to the same stores every week. If you’re a warehouse worker or a store worker and want to earn extra cash just do overtime. This job is really dangerous and the A2D program does not prepare you for the things you will face in just 3 months. Haha and you’ll only make around $11 to $20 an hour for all the time you spend in the truck and away from your family. That’s why people are quitting this miserable job. Plus you get so much sun damage.,yIZRffLA294

I don't think that alters my analysis enormously, but it hints that Sammie hasn't rejected church entirely. 3) I don't mention it in the video, but it's worth adding here that the vampires are associated with Irish paganism. 4) If there's anything else, do let me know, and I'll add them to this pinned comment!

While you mention 'Blues Music' being one of the 'forms of spirituality', I don't feel as though you went quite as' Meta' with it as in context as I did / do.
Music was the one overall force that every other spirituality relied on (used) to try to further their own power in the world.  Whether it was the vampires using it to lure and tie their victims together, the twins using it to increase their wealth & power, the sinners using it to free themselves from the world around, the multicultural dancers communicating with the dead, or the preacher indoctrinating children with 'This Little Light of Mine'... ALL of the 'sub-spiritualities' relied on music to further their personal goals.  And, at the end of the day, it was ALL that the musician needed to feel he had lived a fulfilled life.",s0GDWq4lQrY

@carltonmcgee8878,4,"Dope breakdown. My takeaway is that one can be imprisoned by their gift in pursuit of what that gift brings. In life we're confronted with choices, the character Sammie made up his mind that day he was going to play the Blues and take the good with the bad and strike out on his own (sometimes you have to go at it alone). And as all of us do when we get into trouble we go back home, as Sammie did, because home provides familiarity and solace. But the need to nourish and share our gift with the world is paramount so we must leave our comfort zone to prove that we can make it in the cruel, cruel world. Sammie had already faced his fears; he danced with the Devil and lived to talk about it. But, to me, the biggest take away is the one that has slipped right under our noses and most, that have seen this movie and provided their breakdown, have yet to mention: that folks aren't whom are what they portray themselves to be.

Yet it all goes back even farther - long before Southern Africans migrated down to the Nile and established Egypt. So it's relationship and ties to - and in - the film is at once a dichotomy and complimentary. In addition to the fact that American Indian ancestry is present in a very large contingent of so called 'negro' or today's 'black' peoples. That's why many of us identity as melanated Aboriginal and/or African descended Americans.

@yuijghju,0,"Human Rights Lawyer David Matas

Mr. David Matas addresses the audience at the film screening.

After Mr. Matas’s presentation, some audience members asked what could be done to stop the forced organ harvesting. Mr. Matas responded that medical technology was developed to improve people’s health and living standards, but in China it has been abused and used as a tool for large-scale human rights violations and mass killings. He emphasized that in response to this problem, the medical industry and people from all walks of life have begun to take action.

New legislation has been requested in Japan to ban organ transplant tourism, and many people have contributed by spreading information about the atrocities in China. The film screening emphasized that it is important not to be indifferent to the problem of forced organ harvesting, and everyone should do what they can. It was brought up that it’s crucial that more people pay attention to the issue and take action to promote a resolution to the problem through information dissemination and signature collection campaigns.

The CCP’s forced organ harvesting was first revealed by witnesses who fled China, and investigations were carried based on their testimonies. Several films have been produced to expose these egregious human rights violations. Although there are few witnesses and evidence is difficult to obtain, many people have put forth great effort to make sure that this issue is not forgotten.


Mr. David Matas

During the film and ensuing discussion, it was made clear that the issue of forced organ harvesting in China is an organized crime in which the state participates, targeting prisoners of conscience—mainly Falun Gong practitioners. The international community has expressed serious concern about what is happening in China.

The testimonies of Falun Gong practitioners play an important role in exposing forced organ harvesting. The testimonies indicate that Falun Gong practitioners underwent blood tests in prison, and many practitioners have simply disappeared. This organ transplant compatibility testing is ongoing, and Falun Gong practitioners’ biodata is included in a massive databank. Those who are selected as organ donors are killed as part of the process of organ transplantation.",YgOyoGKq4Ys

Avowed for example is far less complex visually and the gameplay mechanics are almost nonexistent  in some areas yet runs horribly no matter what settings i use

@brokl26,6,"Jesse Lee, the catcher on my slow pitch team, was the “Greatest” catcher in the history of organized sports. He batted in the mid .250s  but his real talent was his defensive prowess. There was never a successful steal or bunt against Jesse Lee. Of course back in the 80s, it was illegal to steal or bunt in slow pitch but that doesn’t change the fact that offensive players never stole or bunted against Jesse. 
Jesse Lee also played about thirty-two percent of his games sober, and that too might be a record in our league. Added to that sober record, Jesse Lee made eighty-one percent of the return tosses back to the pitcher, and that’s a team record. 
Jesse Lee also lead the state in softly hit infield ground ball outs by a batter as well as infield pop-up outs by a batter. So that proves Jesse Lee was a dual threat as a hitter and kept the opponents infield honest and busy. 
It was an honor to play with a catcher with the pure talents that Jesse Lee possessed. And if I’m being honest, the only other catcher in the league that had talents anywhere near the talents of Jesse Lee was “Blind” Al. But “Blind” Al didn’t see it that way. “Blind” Al thought that “Blind” Al was the greatest catcher ever. Man was “Blind” Al arrogant. I mean, how good could “Blind” Al be if he needed someone to hold his hand and lead him around the bases? Our team beat “Blind” Al’s team fifteen head to head games in a row. You would think “Blind” Al’s team would have had a faster outfield since they were all in racing style wheelchairs. Each one of those fifteen consecutive victories were decided by single digits so that proves our team knew how to win close games. And Jesse Lee did his part by upping his batting average to ,268 during the streak. Jesse Was simply built different. 5’5” and about 265 pounds.

It's very hard to explain it, but it seems on the last two albums the songs are sounding less and less like Ghost and it seems they could have been done by other bands. To me, the perfect Ghost album was Prequelle. It was loaded with killer melodic songs that still had some of the old Ghost sound/themes in them (Rats/Faith/Life Eternal/Witch Image/Danse Macabre); 5 perfect songs plus the very good Pro Memoria , See the Light, and Miasma).

@1904-d3x,1,The new lens is half the price of the camera.??? I hope they paid you a lot of money for this because that is shady as s*** I'd say a quarter is worth it a quarter. The price? Fantastic. I'll buy your product but half the price of the camera. I already damaged the camera. I might as well buy a new one. Ridiculous Casey. I get it. You're old you're like. I'm so rich. I'll just do a tube when get paid enough😂😂 we adore you Mr. Nystat. But half the price of the camera. Tell him to drop it to a quarter. They'll get more quality over quantity,Ud2BcD5NC2A

@1904-d3x,0,"Great touch to rock old clothes and really captivate exactly what you're conveying on cameras come from here to there. Lacoste T-shirt nostalgic, well done! It's hilarious one not many will understand but that's what makes you an awesome storyteller and you can be like. Hey that's just my everyday. You were which it probably is but so the nostalgic of an old camera and an old t-shirt. Oh my goodness kids are going to be conferencing about you in labs in college about videography from here on out 🤣😂 I'm just a mom 44 year old mom who sees stuff to much in depth🤣",Ud2BcD5NC2A
@1904-d3x,0,So I can't stop thinking about your Lacoste Shirt. My brothers rocked back in the 1900$.lol,Ud2BcD5NC2A

@silvertheta630,63,"We went from 55% when I went to bed to 44% when I woke up. This mode shows exactly what's wrong with the real world. People just can't work together even when told the benefit of doing so. There's literally no incentive to destroy other squads in this mode, yet every game i play there are idiots going around busting other squads. SMH!",x-spEnJJSeQ
@natsfer,37,What's the point when there are so many people who don't seem to understand the game? Not busting the Monster together but going after teh other squads. DUH. Unlike Hatchlings. This is so pointless.,x-spEnJJSeQ
@anamourao585,21,"This mode it is so hard, even if we try to help each other we end up atacking other players. And in the final rank the players that try to help with the monters end up at last place with no rewards for playing.",x-spEnJJSeQ
@A.Mack1o2,9,@SquadBusters this is literally a pointless game mode with pvp you must've known idiots would try to eliminate players to ruin it.,x-spEnJJSeQ
@Glowpasa,7,"U guys break the game, make players leave and then put out a new mode where participation is required? Now players are losing to NPCs by 10%. Brilliant.",x-spEnJJSeQ

@ReRe0280,3,I play for 2 hours and the bar goes from 50% down to 44%. I didn’t die once and killed a bunch of monsters. This should be an individual event like chicken run for prizes. Just a waste of time. Another squad buster fail. When’s the update?,x-spEnJJSeQ

@kenhonigman6867,2,This is pointless !  To stand beside another player to help defeat beast only makes you attack the other player as well…big thumbs down,x-spEnJJSeQ

@mrdominius7797,2,"I like the activity. 
But there is a big problem, the players don't cooperate and only think about destroying other teams.

@putrinurinqurratuainibinti3934,1,the other players who probably dont want to defeat monsters are literally chasing for other players. play other modes instead please. we are literally avoiding other squads while defeating monsters. like AnatMB.. so many others i cant remember its annoying,x-spEnJJSeQ
