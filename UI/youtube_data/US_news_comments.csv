@milanamughal,0,"I am so glad that I wasn’t the only one - when I heard her teary story, first thought “why was she not manufacturing inside the US”? How many placemats or bibs she makes in “$150K” worth of product? Cheap labor in China is not about selling them cheaper. Look at the prices! It’s about making extra in reducing labor cost. It’s not about the retail buyer. And she mortgaged her house in this. Why would she do something like this? And I am not a business owner or a manufacturer. I merely follow common sense and pay attention to the price of the product. She uses less then 1 cent worth of silicone per placemat. So, whatever the expenses - this still would be making her money, still provide a comfortable life had she been paying a domestic company to make them. It is called being greedy and not thinking ahead. Overseas production is always the greatest risk. Tomorrow they will close boarders. Or get sanctioned. Or nationalize all manufacturing in the country. And you lose everything. I am not talking 145% in tariffs - everything! When you manufacture at home - you have so many tools to protect your business and investments better. Yet green makes them run to China, Cambodia, Vietnam, other southeast Asian countries. Some Eastern European countries that were not swallowed by EU yet. If she was not afraid to lose everything - why is she upset about a tariff payment?",ZXG9o8Vj4tw

I also think the universities are very much fucked by woke and DEI etc (although there's a larger educational reform problem underlying too). I think this should be accomplished by reversing or eliminating regulations that mandate DEI, or establish new laws that make it illegal etc. But after that leave it to free market to implement or comply.

@grantandrews5795,1,"Unc got something off with him, does anyone else have that gut feeling? the interview that really made me raise an eyebrow was Shannon’s recent interview with lil yachty - the man couldn’t keep himself from mentioning yachtys net worth /money throughout the entire interview it felt like Shannon was thirsty and jealous for his money and power. 

While that’s not a sexual assault indication directly, it demonstrated a major crack in his character - I’m honestly not very surprised about this incident and even if not legally guilty, there is SOMETHING off about this man. 

Shannon’s defense in this case is also highly questionable IMO. He’s essentially just attacking the accuser and didn’t really say anything to defend his innocence, rather discredit the accuser. This looks overly defensive from Unc and is very concerning",HtwLF1PbB4g

Board of Education decision was handed down by the Supreme Court in this year, so let's concoct a little story about how you were so concerned about school segregation a year or so before.
He has told other stories like that where you'd say it's exceedingly unlikely to have occurred, but in principle it could have happened. Another such example is him saying he saw two men kissing in public and when he asked his dad, he was told ""they love each other.""
Another class of stories he tells about his past are those that take just a little bit of digging to readily prove he's lying. But even after refuted, he would continue to those stories, confident that his primary audience didn't know any better.

@Barbara-l2x,1,China is walking away from Trumps Trade Tariff Tyrany. China only exports 14% of its goods to the US so stopping that will be painful but other countries will be found to trade with like the EU and Canada. Trump can raise his tariffs to 1000000000% and it would make no difference becaue China has walked away. They won't be the only ones. Without Trust and with insane irratic tariffs you cannot trade with the US but have to trade around them instead. Will check back in 5 years to see if there is a sane government again but until then best of luck with your splendid self imposed trade isolation.,B2W67uTbB34

@tedtratt9553,0,Why does the proper running of the legal system depend on the affiliation of its court members. Other countries manage to avoid this by appointing members who have shown through their histories they are able to be impartial and put their reputations first. You seem to appoint people who are known to have extreme views and a penchant for not being too concerned about legalities or their reputations. You definitely need to fix this with regulation that does not depend on the politics of the party in power governing any outcomes.,HJOrapS3IVg
