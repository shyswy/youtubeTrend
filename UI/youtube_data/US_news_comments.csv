Now children do this because they do not understand concepts like boundaries yet.
They don't do it out of malice, they literally don't know better (yet).
You wait until they get tired, and then you teach them why what they did was wrong.

What we are seeing is adults in other countries waiting for Donald to get tired.

@bencheevers6693,0,"You guys are being played for fools, Trump's plan is ask for something outrageous and then be happy with the 'sensible' thing which was anchored on that outrageous ask. 3 weeks is fine, the procedure is going to take less than a week, the amount of time each habeas needs is minimal, there doesn't need to be a hearing, motion practice is sufficient to meet due process requirements, the government already has all the information they need to present the court, the standards are incredibly low, it's not a criminal penalty and most of it isn't justiciable anyways. Whatever roadblocks happen now are just a fight that needs to be had to establish the process for mass removal. 10 million immigration hearings along with 10 millon years long proceedings is not feasible and that's the point. 3 weeks and even if the motion is filed at the end of that time period, only adds a couple extra days, turning over the detention centres every month is more than they can apprehend so that's not a bottleneck for the system. Also, key here is that habeas is not appeal able without leave from the judge or chief judge and it's the southern district of Texas. There's no relief for any of these people, it's not that more process would get them a different result, it would just logjam the system which is the point.

This whole procedure isn't limited to a certain class of migrants but litigating this based on that class is how to get the best result which is why they're first, asylum is barred after a year and the temporary protected status that Biden implemented is gonzo",nGIXaujHW_U

A man was deported and sent to jail with members of his gang, he kept in touch with other gang members, he was given enough lawyers to prove his innocence, senator J Kennedy says five million dollars was spent on his defence at the tax payers dollar. I will take the senator‚Äôs word that it was a screw up, a case of the wrong place at the wrong time with very bad company, maybe the man was no longer active in the gang, but he kept their company, I would say he has some blame in the screw up.",sVraA9BthzM

The event happened in the final stretch of the 2024 Presidential election, an intensely critical time, Harris was under immense scrutiny because many observers were commenting on her inability to string a coherent sentence together and many thought this made her unfit for the job. The fact that 60 Minutes allowed this clip to be altered in a way that impacted directly on the way she would be perceived in this context was inexcusable and Donald Trump and his team are 1000% correct to hold 60 Minutes to task on this.
