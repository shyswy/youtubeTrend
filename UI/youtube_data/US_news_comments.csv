@david-c7i7t,0,"All this nonsense and millions being spent on deportations, which may be an economic mistake anyway. Millions of working-class  Americans voted Republican for possibly the first time because of promises to bring down living costs and increase our wage packets to alleviate our declining standard of living.  Instead, things appear to have gone quite the reverse.  Living costs have gone up around $4000 a year.  Which, for many, means cutting back and going without. Which, if I believe what I am being told, will cause more economic problems if domestic demand substantially reduces. We are continually being told this is temporary and that once the GOP gets its policies working, we are, if I can quote, ""all going to have so much money we won't know what to do with it""  And we should ignore all the propaganda and lies of the leftwing press.

Honestly, I find the current huge division in the 2 very distinct groups in our once wonderful country very worrying. Each group appears to live in a completely different reality, believing a completely different set of facts and rules. This division is prominent in many current situations. One major example is the fundamental argument that the Biden Administration was completely incompetent and is the cause of the current US financial crisis, which would have got far worse had it not been for the actions now being taken  by President Trump.",yEPHxZTGbLc

Slovenia did it peacefully 1991, splitting from Yugoslavia (Melania Trump's country).  Czechoslavakia did it peacefully in 1992, splitting into Czech Republic and Slovakia.  No need for a Civil War.

RED STATES/Territories can trade with each other Tarriff free, and enjoy BIGLY FOREIGN TARRIFFS - in Trump's Nazi kingdom!

@RuHo16,2,"Very sad about what happened, but I would like to say something I have witnessed in my college. This goes to all the professors who like to take it too far with their political views. A year ago, I took a Sociology class, and the professor was a freak democrat. Every class period, he would show us articles that talked bad about republicans, cops, the military, the US, etc. Basically, it was all propaganda and biased info, and hateful comments. As an immigrant who doesn‚Äôt care about politics much, I will say that that class was the most stressful class I have ever taken. Behind me was a guy who had just returned from the military. He was very quiet and would leave the class whenever the professor made hateful comments. I don‚Äôt think there was a time I wasn‚Äôt shaking. The guy probably was the best person in the world, but knowing that he had just returned from military service and probably had PTSD, and hearing about all these school shootings that were happening, I was terrified. One time, the professor showed us a video on how the military is trained and brainwashed, and the songs they sang during the training, and the guy behind me got up very quickly, not happy at all, and left. That night, I thought I was gonna die, but he did not come back, and later he dropped the class. So please, leave your political sh*t at home.

@HarrisonBergeronIsHere,0,"How can anyone look to Trump for leadership, honesty or integrity when the trail he leaves behind him is littered with slime, broken promises, poor decisions, stiffed vendors, a devastated reputation and history of repeated failure? ¬†A short list includes:

1. Trump University or the Trump Entrepreneur Initiative (2004-2010) ‚Äî Trump staged wealth-building seminars costing up to $34,995 for mentorships that would offer students access to Trump's secrets of success. Instructors turned out to be motivational speakers sometimes with criminal records. Lawsuits and criminal investigations abound. The for-profit education company ended in a $25 million settlement over fraud lawsuits without admitting wrongdoing.

2. Trump Institute - A separate failed business from Trump University, offering real estate seminars under a licensing agreement until 2009. Trump endorsed the program through infomercials despite not being involved in its operations.

3. Trump Vodka (2006-2011) ¬†A luxury vodka brand that failed to meet sales thresholds and was discontinued.

4. Trump Airlines (1989-1992) ¬†Trump borrowed $365 million to purchase Eastern Air Shuttle, which he rebranded ""Trump Airlines"". He added gold bathroom fixtures. Two years later Trump could not cover the interest payment on his loan and defaulted on a $1.1 million loan repayment and eventually ceased operations

5. Trump Steaks (2007) An attempt to break into the meat industry that ended shortly after its launch. Trump Steaks was pulled from shelves within two months due to low sales while owing Buckhead Beef $715,000.¬†

6. GoTrump.com (2006-2007) ¬†A luxury travel search engine shut down after a year due to critique and lack of traction.

7. Trump Mortgages (2006-2007) ¬†Trump told CNBC in 2006 that ""I think it's a great time to start a mortgage company ‚Ä¶ The real-estate market is going to be very strong for a long time to come."" Then the real estate market collapsed. Trump had hired E.J. Ridings as CEO of Trump Mortgage and boasted that Ridings had been a ""top executive of one of Wall Street's most prestigious investment banks."" Turned out Ridings had only six months of experience as a stockbroker. Trump Mortgage closed and never paid a $298,274 judgment it owed a former employee, nor the $3,555 it owed in unpaid taxes.

8. Trump Ice (2004-2010) marketed under the ""Trump Ice"" brand, promised one of the purest bottled waters but was known for its low mineral content and plastic bottling, critiqued as more of a vehicle for Trump's image than a testament to water quality‚Äã‚Äã.

9. Trump Magazine (2007-2009) - Trump Style and Trump World were renamed Trump Magazine to reap advertising dollars from his name recognition. However, Trump Magazine quickly went out of business, shut down with suggesting significant un-recouped investment in publication and distribution.

10. Trump Tower Tampa (2006-2007) - shelved due to financing and market challenges, indicating significant investment losses and lost deposits.

11. Trump SoHo Hotel (2008-2017) - struggled with occupancy rates, ¬†investment and operational losses, and compounded by legal fees.

12. Trump Taj Mahal (1990-2016) - Opened with grandeur but faced immediate financial distress, multiple bankruptcies, ¬†operational losses underscoring significant financial failure.

13. Trump Marina - Opened in 1985 in Atlantic City as Trump's Castle, this casino resort was renamed Trump Marina in 1997. Despite the rebranding efforts and strategic location, the property struggled with financial stability and was sold after multiple challenges, including a near foreclosure in the late 1990s.

14. Trump‚Äôs World Fair at Trump Plaza - another casino venture in Atlantic City, was opened in 1996 failed to draw the expected crowds and revenue, leading to its closure in 1999.

15. Trump Baku Hotel (Never opened) - A luxury hotel project in Azerbaijan that faced legal and financial issues that halted this project, suggesting sunk costs in development and planning without the realization of potential revenues or returns.

16. Trump Plaza Hotel and Casino (1984-2014) - Once a landmark in Atlantic City, it went through multiple bankruptcies before closing, indicating substantial financial losses over its operational life due to declining revenues.

17. Trump International Hotel and Tower Dubai (Never realized) - shelved in 2008,
the failed venture reflects lost investments in planning and pre-development stages.

18. Trump International Hotel and Tower New Orleans (Never realized)

19. Trump Tower Palm Beach (Never realized) - Faced local opposition and environmental concerns, quickly scrapped.

20. Trump Tower Charlotte (Never realized) another example of Trump experiencing financial losses related to planning and initial development efforts without achieving fruition.

21. Trump: The Game (1989, 2005). ¬†Milton Bradley tried to sell it. As did Hasbro. After investment, the game died and went out of circulation.¬†

22. Trump Foundation (Fraudulent Charity) (1988-2018) - A private foundation started by Donald Trump, dissolved by court order in 2018 following a series of legal violations. The foundation was scrutinized for unethical and illegal activities,, culminated in Trump being ordered to pay $2 million in damages for misusing charitable funds for political gains.

23. Trump Winery in Charlottesville, Virginia, managed by Eric. Despite claims of being the largest winery on the East Coast, Trump Winery is not the largest either by volume of wine produced or acreage under vine in Virginia, let alone the East Coast.

24. Trump Fragrances (2004-2015) - Donald Trump's ventures into the fragrance market, branded ""Donald Trump, The Fragrance"", a ""Success by Trump"", ""Empire by Trump"" all failed due to lack of sales.¬†

25. Truth Social, the social media platform launched by Donald Trump's Trump Media & Technology Group (TMTG), reported substantial financial losses, amounting to $31.6 million from its launch until mid-2023. In 2023 alone, regulatory filings and company reports‚Äãhighlighted losses of $58 million.

26. ¬†Trump Mattresses ‚Äî Serta stopped offering a Trump-branded mattress, again due to low sales.¬†

27. ¬†Trumpnet ‚Äî A telephone communication company that abandoned its trademark.¬†


Trump isn‚Äôt good at being president. He‚Äôs a weak leader, a terrible negotiator, and a horrible judge of character. He failed in the Covid crisis and, through unfunded tax breaks for the rich, fumbled the prosperity he‚Äôd inherited from Obama. Presidents throughout the years have differed in their approaches to policy, based on political platforms, ideologies and individual beliefs. Trump, however, has shown highly abnormal behavior by lying constantly to the American people, with contempt for the truth, abusing power to intentionally fuel divisions in our country and actively working to degrade the imperfect but critical institutions that serve us.¬†


His greed is limitless. He views wealth as his path to grandiosity and admiration. Trump intends to pass Elon as the richest person on earth. While the honest folk are distracted by Elon's shenanigans, Trump's betrayal of Ukraine, DEI hysteria, tariffs and hatred for immigrants (other than his wife), the heists are being planned. ¬†


Elites including Trump, through institutions, own most of the crypto. ¬†Trump has his DeFi (Decentralized Finance) project World Liberty Financial, which has become a sort of slush fund of various tokens. Seventy-five percent of the protocol‚Äôs revenues goes to affiliates of the presidential family. His social media company, Trump Media and Technology Group, has applied to launch ‚ÄúTruth.Fi Bitcoin Plus ETF,‚Äù a garble of letters that points toward Trump owning his own exchange-traded fund full of crypto. In addition, the Trumps are selling the meme coins $TRUMP and $MELANIA. ¬†Eric and Donald Trump Jr. are turning prospectors as they bolster the Trump digital currency portfolio by acquiring a 20 percent stake in crypto-infrastructure company American Bitcoin, which will merge with Eric and Don Jr.‚Äôs company American Data Centers as part of the deal. The Wall Street Journal reports that the deal is part of a grand scheme to create the world‚Äôs largest Bitcoin mining operation.¬†


The elites need a mechanism to get liquid (i.e. - sell). ¬†The Chinese won't buy it. ¬†They know a scam when they see one! ¬†The U.S. Treasury will be the sucker! ¬†Trump has signed an executive order to establish a Strategic Bitcoin Reserve and a U.S. Digital Asset Stockpile. Trump will find a way to ""borrow"" (print) trillions of dollars in order to ""invest"" in the crypto reserve. The taxpayer will be left holding the bag. ‚ÄúTaxation is theft. It should be kept to a minimum,‚Äù Joe Lonsdale, a tech entrepreneur and self-proclaimed blockchain booster, posted on X. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs wrong to steal my money for grift on the left; it‚Äôs also wrong to tax me for crypto bro schemes.‚Äù


A second heist is front running. The Trump insiders buy puts - leveraged bets that a market will fall. ¬†Trump then announces a huge, belligerent tariff that will drive down the market. ¬†When the market bottoms out, exercise the put and use the windfall to buy calls on the very index that was just bet against. Trump then announces that the tariff is off, at least for a while, so the index rises. ¬†Trump and the insiders again triple their money, or more. ¬†Rinse and repeat the following week! ¬†The scam only works if you know in advance what the president is going to do. ¬†Donate a million and maybe get a tip?",gNson4TqUO4

One would think that MAGA would want real men instead of these hyperinflated, compensatory, little boys and perpetual emotional infantiles, masquerading as adults as 'leaders'. Hegseth is the reflection of Trump. The bitter irony here is that Hegseth is the 'leader' of America's greatest socialist entity, which is the military industrial complex. A bunch of corporations paid by ripped-off taxpayer money. America's fire departments are socialist entities, just as are America's police forces. The same can be said about Musk's corporate entities, which have received nearly $40 billion of the taxpayer's monies. When the taxpayers pay for something, it's socialism.",X-_6U_gzyfs

@adorabledeplorble8497,33,"Ignacio Cruz-Mendoza was driving for Monique Trucking (and he was also not registered as a CDL holder in Mexico). He killed an off-duty truck driver (Scott Miller) and injured a handful of others, and at least one other injury was critical, yet Cruz-Mendoza was not injured. He left Cheyenne on June 11, not sure of his destination, and he did not know when his truck was last inspected (investigation showed it was four years prior). He was attempting to pass five vehicles in a 45mph zone (seven hours later) when he sideswiped them and caused a 14 hour road closure. He said his brakes went out, but there were skid marks at the scene and he was apparently not shifted into the right gear. He needed an interpreter in court. Somehow they listed everything as misdemeanor charges, gave him less than a year in jail, and even listed him as white in JeffCo jail. In July FMCSA declared his employer an imminent hazard to public safety after the leadership demonstrated a lack of knowledge of safety regulations (they had also had multiple violations within two years prior to this crash). Cruz-Mendoza had previously been pulled over in multiple states and also had at least one drug charge awhile back.

The number of failures in this entire story, including how any one station may breadcrumb the public by reporting on just a small piece of it, or how every agency involved may have done a crap ton more to ensure public safety, is all beyond insulting. That said, at least we are adding to his travels again and this actually did make the news. I am not an investigative reporter, but I was compelled to dig a little more on this last year. My only hope now is that our current administration can prevent him from returning again and that Scott Miller‚Äôs family and anyone else injured can now somehow find peace and healing. 

This story deserves more than 28 seconds of air time and a little bit of shock and awe over the number of deportations.",PMYGkC9Fiqo
