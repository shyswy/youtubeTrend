0y7hSzUYlJM,"Trump Redecorates White House in ALL GOLD, Still Waiting on Epstein Files & Canadians are MAD!",Jimmy Kimmel Live,25,뉴스,2949319,83619,"Easter weekend is upon us and there doesn’t seem to be a lot of Easter spirit this year, Easter Bunnies at the mall have been particularly lonely this year, Easter and 4/20 will fall on the same day for the only time until 2087, egg prices are so high that there has been an outpouring of ideas for other stuff to color, the Dollar Tree is being affected by tariffs, Trump has been doing an Extreme Makeover of the White House by turning everything, the Prime Minister of Italy stopped by to try and talk some sense into him, we’re still awaiting the release of the Epstein files, This Week in Unnecessary Censorship, and we introduce our first ever “Angry Canadian of the Night.” Between the tariffs and this nonsense about becoming a state Canadians have really bonded. They have a common enemy now and it’s us! So if you are a Canadian who would like to share you consternation, record yourself and upload it on the social media platform of your choosing (except for X - we do not use that) with #PUCKOFF.

lXsSFPht5qM,"Houthis ATTACK US Aircraft Carrier, Then THIS Happened…",The Military Show,25,뉴스,1351752,19951,"The Houthis just did the unthinkable—targeting a U.S. aircraft carrier. On March 17, 2025, the USS Harry S. Truman faced a full-scale drone and missile attack in the Red Sea. But not a single hit landed. So how did the Navy pull it off? And what would’ve happened if just one drone made it through? Let’s break down the tech, tactics, and stakes behind this modern naval showdown.

LzFXAVsDMCU,Terrence Howard Reveals What Really Happened To Diddy’s Adopted Daughter| Diddy SOLD Her?,Misstee,25,뉴스,231695,16128,"Terrence Howard Reveals What Really Happened To Diddy’s Adopted Daughter| Diddy SOLD Her?

Y’all, Terrence Howard just brought evidence of Diddy allegedly his adopted daughter, Ava, and things are about to get out of hand. We thought that Terrence was done with Diddy when he claimed that Diddy tried to put moves on him, but it turns out that Terrence might know more than he told us on the podcast.

And get this: it looks like the feds have caught on to this, because they just updated the indictment against Diddy. They added two new charges and included new victims to the original list of charges. Well, word on the streets is that Ava is allegedly one of the new victims. And like that’s not crazy enough, rumor has it that she will be taking the stand to testify against Diddy in the trial.

Things are starting to heat up, and it looks like Terrence just might be the one to take Diddy down, so let’s break this down.
