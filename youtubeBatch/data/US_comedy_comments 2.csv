Not just in America or other western country, but almost every part of the world doesn't care about bullying. This also happened to me in elementary school. My friend bullied me. And the teacher?? They also bully me. Crazy?? No, its already a habit on this cruel world. Freedom is the right of all sentient beings. We must never lose sight of the fact that upon this earth, we have minds and hearts. And such power, must be used wisely...",aNFzZhWleDs

@KacyCallahan,1,I like how like nobody was talking when she said that they had to do 10 papers in one night  about bullying and the only person who doesn’t have to do it is the person she was defending. I feel like that’s really nice because like most teachers like they give the whole class even the person that was being made fun of.,aNFzZhWleDs

Makes their day and makes mine too. Who knows what type of day they're having with all the crazy people out there. A little kindness doesn't cost much but can change a person's whole day and mood.

Also... there's an added benefit to it too because the delivery guys most definitely remember the ones who give them snacks. And they usually return the favour by being very considerate when delivering a package. It's a bonus win. :D",tvwKsRx16zo

Always appreciated the houses that acknowledge that it was real work. What most people don’t understand is that you never get a real break to eat, drink, or pee; God forbid, if you ever had to poop. It was the most dehumanizing job I’ve ever had. I will always respect the delivery drivers and love the people who show kindness and respect: most will treat you like dirt who dares to stain their property even if you’re just delivering what they ordered.
