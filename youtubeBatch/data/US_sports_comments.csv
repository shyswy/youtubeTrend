@brookeSH1,2,"here’s the history of Asian people 😊(i’m bored) 






Migrations of distinct ethnolinguistic groups have probably occurred as early as 10,000 years ago. However, around 2,000 BCE early Iranian speaking people and Indo-Aryans arrived in Iran and northern Indian subcontinent. Pressed by the Mongols, Turkic peoples often migrated to the western and northern regions of the Central Asian plains. Prehistoric migrants from South China and Southeast Asia seem to have populated East Asia, Korea and Japan in several waves, where they gradually replaced indigenous people, such as the Ainu, who are of uncertain origin.[47][48] Austroasiatic and Austronesian people establish in Southeast Asia between 5.000 and 2.000 BCE, partly merging with, but eventually displacing the indigenous Australo-Melanesians.[49][50][51][52]
In terms of Asian people, there is an abundance of ethnic groups in Asia, with adaptations to the climate zones of the continent, which include arctic, subarctic, temperate, subtropical or tropical, as well as extensive desert regions in Central and Western Asia. The ethnic groups have adapted to mountains, deserts, grasslands, and forests, while on the coasts of Asia, resident ethnic groups have adopted various methods of harvest and transport. The types of diversity in Asia are cultural, religious, economic and historical.

Ethnological map of the Pamirs
Some groups are primarily hunter-gatherers- whereas others practice transhumance (nomadic lifestyle), have been agrarian for millennia, or adopted an industrial or urban lifestyle. Some groups or countries in Asia are completely urban (e.g., Qatar and Singapore); the largest countries in Asia with regard to population are the China, India, Indonesia, Pakistan, Bangladesh, Japan, Philippines, Vietnam, Iran, Turkey, Thailand, Burma, South Korea, Uzbekistan, and Malaysia. Colonisation of Asian ethnic groups and states by European peoples began in the late 1st millennium BCE, reaching its peak in the late 19th and early 20th centuries.",w_NjR00ij2I

I’m proud of you for eating
I’m proud of you for setting goals
I’m proud of you for getting up
I’m proud of you for learning 
I’m proud of you for trying 
I’m proud of you for smiling
I’m proud of you for going outside
I’m proud of you for spreading kindness 
I’m proud of you for being you
I’m proud of you no matter what
I know you’re insecure but everyone is
I know you’re not happy but your not alone
I know you’re getting bullied but don’t listen to them
I know you’re sad but try to be happy
I know you’re miserable but your still standing 
I know you feel hated but you are loved
I know you feel sad but deep down you’re happy
I know you feel disappointed but you are proud
I know you are depressed but smile!!

insecurities are only real because of society, so ask yourself.. “would you be who you are right now if it weren’t for them?” and what would you say? don’t hate yourself, because you are worth the world! everyone is different and that’s a good thing. don’t be insecure, just set goals! be yourself and learn to love who you are <3
