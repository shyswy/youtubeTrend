@ericfields7218,0,"Dear my country music fans!
Kane Brown can't make a living making music, because he can't sing.  Even 3 or 4 years old toddlers can sing way way better than him.   He has no future in music..
Don't ever collaborate with Kane Brown, because he can't sing.  He will ruin your reputation.
Kane Brown can't even sing a kid's lullaby.  That's why nobody wants to collaborate with him except his wife.  Kane Brown is a dead horse so stop the flogging.   He can't even sing DO, RE, MI, FA, SOL, LA, SI, DO in tune.  How does he even manage to stay in music business?",7kyHvPNbugk
