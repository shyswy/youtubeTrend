@davidace24,0,"Attention, everyone! Warren stated, ""He does not have the authority (which implies he does), unless Congress prevents him from 'keeping' it."" To summarize: Donald Trump holds this authority unless Congress decides to revoke it. With Republicans now controlling both the House and the Senate, they wield considerable power over Congress‚Äôs legislative actions. This allows them to set the agenda and pass laws with fewer obstacles. In essence, while Warren‚Äôs point has merit, the reality is that with Republican control of both chambers, Donald Trump has substantial influence over policy direction.ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è",M5o6Nq6jEdA

Modi's government is being praised for progress, but behind the curtain, India is being forced to buy overpriced jets, roll back nuclear liability laws, and hand over its e-commerce sector to US giants like Walmart and Amazon. While Indian startups bleed, the US walks away with profits and power.
This isn't mutual growth. It's a shopping list‚Äîwritten in Washington and paid for by Indian taxpayers.

@slickjohnc1,1,"When the US manufacturing was a world powerhouse, the workers were in unions and had pensions, made a great wage for living quality.  China is now the manufacturing powerhouse, but their workers are paid poorly and forced to live at the company/government supplied housing, eat food supplied by employer/government, and have a very poor work/life balance. Almost to the point you could argue modern day slavery.  Anyone cheering for China is cheering for slavery mainly from ignorance of perspective.  We did it in a way that was beneficial to our people.
