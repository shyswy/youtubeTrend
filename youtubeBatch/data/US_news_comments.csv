@davidace24,0,"Attention, everyone! Warren stated, ""He does not have the authority (which implies he does), unless Congress prevents him from 'keeping' it."" To summarize: Donald Trump holds this authority unless Congress decides to revoke it. With Republicans now controlling both the House and the Senate, they wield considerable power over Congress’s legislative actions. This allows them to set the agenda and pass laws with fewer obstacles. In essence, while Warren’s point has merit, the reality is that with Republican control of both chambers, Donald Trump has substantial influence over policy direction.🤷‍♂️",M5o6Nq6jEdA

He raised all these countries tarrifs way to high to fast.  Him having to pause the tarriffs proved it.  If biden did what trump is doing yall would have crucified him.

@peymas,1,"JD Vance’s visit to India is being hyped like a blockbuster—trade deals, military tech, economic “growth.” But what’s the real story?
I will tell you  what Indian media isn’t telling you. From nuclear deals to Amazon’s retail takeover, we unpack how the US is strong-arming India into economic submission under the shiny label of a ""$500 billion partnership.""
Modi's government is being praised for progress, but behind the curtain, India is being forced to buy overpriced jets, roll back nuclear liability laws, and hand over its e-commerce sector to US giants like Walmart and Amazon. While Indian startups bleed, the US walks away with profits and power.
This isn't mutual growth. It's a shopping list—written in Washington and paid for by Indian taxpayers.
