@meggtokyodelicious,3,"There's no need to take that many clothes. You can take clothes for 4 days and the rest you can buy at Uniqlo stores...... especially for kids. Avoid carrying things you don't need. 
The other solution is to take old kids clothes, kids wear them , leave in the hotel trash 🗑️, no Laundry 🧺 and no hassle. On top of that you have room in the luggage for souvenirs and gifts. I travelled around the world, it's always nicer to travel with less weight 😊",yu2rAxEq3Bk

@lindamason2220,0,"I just LOVE the first jumpsuit!! So cute! The only thing I would object to is the ""one piece"" part. Especially with kids.

For ME, having even the slightest graze of material meeting a bathroom floor and I would lose my mind. Esp in planes. 

I also see two tired babies in the stall with mom doing whatever they do while mom is navigating the outfit safely above the floor. 

This would be a great time to have Dad on bathroom detail for the kids while mom concentrates on the outfit.

I usually get one or two sweatsuits in fun colors for travel days. Comfy, easy on/off, warm on cold planes, etc. They go great with my Kicks or Sketchers that slip on and off easily without having to sit down, tie, etc.",yu2rAxEq3Bk

@briellecoffman,1,This video gave me so much anxiety cause I have a peanut allergy and I’ve never had crumbl because of this.

@creative2716,0,"I am so sorry for your nutritional allergy to nuts, Mia.  Yes, cross-contamination is a serious error and can kill.  At the very least, let the owner know what has occurred so no one's death is on his/her soul.

I have dairy and flour allergies.  It is not life  threatening anaphylaxis type allergies like yours (thank God). But serious gastronomical upset with IBS type symptoms including bowel issues (similar to Celiac disease). Enough said! And sugar gives me rebound hypoglycemia which results in nausea, sweats and nearly passing out. So I'm no fun to eat out with!

I could not have done more than looked at and smelled the desserts (and drooled).
 
I say NO to desserts on the regular and have fruit popsicles on rare occasions. I skip birthdays, even my own.

Enjoy (those of you who can)!",bxlzbJPvwK8

Also want to say it’s refreshing to see a YouTuber keeping personal stuff more private (especially your pregnancy)!

You’re doing great and congratulations on this next beautiful chapter of life🫶🏼,HYvhPvtUZfk

@magpie5589,2,"For other parents, going cold turkey maybe too much, so with my three I encouraged them to put their Dummy (we 🇬🇧 call a Binki a Dummy) each morning on rising into the cutlery drawer. It stayed there all day and if they wanted it that night they got it for bed. In no time they were so used without it during day that they forgot to get it for bed, and that was it, no more Dummy. 
If during day they were tired and cranky and wanted their dummy I’d distract them etc and they’d soon be ok but that only happened in the first couple of days. 
It was so easy and no distress. 
I just offer this as a help and if I remember rightly someone told me about it when I used it.",8yWTFgWY6-Y

@123maddieme,11,"I would not use a head protector backpack, personally. As a nanny, I’ve seen so many kids learn to walk, crawl and pull up on things and while they will fall, they also learn very quickly how to land safely— aka on their butts or by putting their hands out! I would worry that using this could hinder that very necessary learning experience. Babies heads are basically helmets at that age anyway and a fall from their standing height is extremely unlikely to cause real injury. He will cry when he falls, but he will also learn that someone will be there to comfort him. That pain is temporary, but the love and security is enduring.",qOXgXFEbZPY

I had a baby a month after you did and I can totally relate to the challenges that come with balancing your career and your family. It’s been hard watching the progress of this bathroom build. The design choices seem forced and odd, it’s coming off haphazard. 

I think your real fans can see you’re overwhelmed and are just seeking authenticity from you. The ever changing posting schedule, or the late night posts… to be totally honest it just comes off unprofessional. 

Macenna, I’ll always be a fan and follow along your projects but I hope you take the feedback and give yourself and your family a proper break and come back with a realistic work / life balance. ❤",qOXgXFEbZPY

I do want to add one thing, kids swimming things are crazy patterns and colors because you would be astonished at how hard they are to spot in the water in certain angles and light. It still blows my mind how lifeguards can spot drowning kids in a pool. Please don't go with muted items for safety",qOXgXFEbZPY
@elljay700,6,Will you ever acknowledge that you could have cut the pipe for the shower handle instead of building out the wall?,qOXgXFEbZPY
@schwal11,6,Such an unsolicited advice but the reason for colorful pool accessories and bathing suits are for visual importance and to stand out basically. It’s advice to against blues or whites and to go for the opposite of cool colors so that leaves us w red and yellow and orange because it alerts ppl in case of drowning.

@iliawonders,55,"I work in a sit and fit shoe store and I think you just made me realize how passionate I actually am about it! So many people aren't aware they're wearing the wrong size shoes! (Plus, out feet never stop getting bigger! They flatten and spread as we age) I LOVE the Glycerin 22 and I recommend it to most everyone who comes in for shoes if it fits their shoe goals and needs. My next sneaker will definitely be a glycerin when my current ones die. I'll stop here, I could keep yapping about shoes and stuff forever 😅 thank you for talking about it",qO_6oKxT14c

Bring a personal fan of some kind to stay cool, pack tissues/TP in your bag in case facilities run out, I also usually bring a bandana for an accessory/dry off sweat/cover my face to filter dust or dirt, and stay hydrated! Sometimes they let you bring in empty water bottles that you can fill at water stations but every festival is different. Have fun!",qO_6oKxT14c
@fionakramer4220,12,"I love my brooks, I am sure you will love them as well. 

Regarding festival suggestions: 
-a flashlight for late night shenanigans 
-Nile file, a glue, scissors and clips for (wardrope) emergencies 
- a water pouch (at least here in Europe)  
-a carabiner to clip your purse shut so that it can’t be stolen
-comfortable shoes!!! 
-ear plugs to protect your heading 
-wipes and disinfectant 
-a card game to pass the time",qO_6oKxT14c

But you’re teaching yourself trades and executing them at a high level.  It’s inspiring to watch.  I remind myself now when I embark on a large, detail intensive project, that I can do this.  Just slow it down, focus, do one step at a time and eventually the completion will arrive.  I’ve watched plenty of renovations done by professionals where a complicated shower installation like this has taken much longer than the timeframe you managed here.

@alliehook2586,1,I am not denying the amount of work you put into this shower but the floor and the niche missed the mark. The marble is beautiful but to see it continue into the niche would appear more cohesive. As well as the floor tile. Something about it just seems off.,R4RoCpDFf9Q
@lindabell5534,1,I'm thinking the shower floor ties colors look different from what they look.

@iloverollypollies,1,"I am a medical advocate & I have had doctors who were refusing to order breast ultra sound and by the end of it they had it ordered and were apologizing to me. On the other end I have also had many doctors hang up on me in the middle of phone visits. LOL

If you call your insurance and ask them to refer you to a ""Care Coordinator"" or a ""Community Health Worker"" these people can attend your appointments WITH YOU to make sure you are getting the right treatment/ advocate for you in the doctors. 
If you are alone at the doctor though here are some tips for advocating for yourself 

-State how your symptoms effect your daily life (Like how you said it was keeping you up all night) 
-If the doctor doesn't ask about your symptoms before saying something negative, then call them out say ""You did not even ask about my symptoms yet"" 
- Try to book repeat appointments with doctors you enjoy/ make you feel comfortable. Eventually they could be your primary care & then you hopefully only have to see them in the future
-Fight back, give em a lil argument, they love it.  In every relationship people say ""Its healthy to have arguments because it means you are expressing all your feelings and coming to compromise"" Then how come it isnt this way with doctors? 
If you feel that your life would genuinely benefit from just a little bit of medicine, then debate, fight, site facts, state your mind.  
Say ""Yknow what, since I have kids, I actually don't have time to come back in a few days, so If you could give me medicine NOW. Thank you""",VevsyFBZdP0

@lexyeast4896,0,"I saw someone recently talking about advocating for yourself at the Dr. They suggested asking the Dr to add ""Can you add a note to my chart that says, 'I asked for treatment and you refused?'"" That way, if something happens or if you get worse, there is a record of it, but 9 times out of 10 they don't want that liability so they'll reconsider what you're asking for. I haven't personally tried this yet, but it sounds like good advice. Also, I've had good luck with honey just straight from the spoon (not mixed with water or tea).

Day you get the injection put ice packs on your knees and do not walk around so that the injection can settle in place and it will last and work well.  I can get the medical name they use if you need it, it really makes a huge difference, if you had Osgood-Schlatter knee issues as a kid this should help.

@thenesthomestead,2,My wife and I are curious how you identify male and female plant varieties? We are newer in our homesteading journey and doing our best to learn every day <3 - Dakota & Angela,l5EBlpXgEpY
@Milen983,2,"I remember my grandpa had grafted an extremely delicious plum that I have tried only several times from the stores in my home country Armenia. They were rare variety, and I haven’t found them in any other store, those I found several times were very close but not exactly those. My point is, those grafted branches dried easily when after a while we weren’t able to regularly water that part of the garden. While the wild branches from the same tree continued to grow robustly. So we lost those nice grafted trees. Grafted trees are good but my impression is they are more fragile than the wild or seed grown ones.",l5EBlpXgEpY
@mikedoingmikethings702,1,"I grow fruit trees and vegetables here in Satans Armpits known as Las Vegas, Nv and a lot of people think that I have a ""green thumb"" for growing plants and fruit trees in my backyard... but the truth is, i killed many plants and I refused to give up...

most ""part time gardeners"" wanted to buy a tree and want them fruiting like yesterday and like you stated, most of these plants came from out of state that they may look fine for a few months, but comes summer time, the growth are stunted because of our intense heat and most of the time the trees will never recover and dies. Just like what you're doing, you are looking for plants that are either native to the area or that are ""acclimated"" to the zone/area. This is very important because plants for miraculous ways, creates tolerance to its environment, thus buying from a local hobbyist that have fruit trees growing in the area for at least one season is ideal vs from a big box stores or nurseries that stocks items from out of state...",l5EBlpXgEpY
@rockyhighwayroad7365,1,I have heard about the seeds not being true to the plant if grafting was involved but are you sure about the cuttings also being different? Cuttings are generally clones of the parent plant,l5EBlpXgEpY

@mirror71,6,"You're bang on with that comment about HOAs liking well-kept containers and raised beds. 

Last year, I put a 6'x4'x29"" Birdie's bed adjacent to my deck in the back of my townhome and hung some rectangular planters from the railings, all without asking or informing my HOA (~400 townhomes). It is in view of about a half dozen neighbors. Better to ask for forgiveness, right?

Throughout the season (6A), I grew tomatoes, arugula, lettuce, kale, and onions in the bed and a cucumber plant in a small grow bag beside it. Some of the planters had flowers to attract pollinators, and the rest had a rotation of leafy greens. At the end of the season, I chopped and dropped, started some garlic and seeded a mix of tall and short lavender for cover. 

A bit before the end of the season, right when the insanely productive tomatoes and cukes were at their peak, the HOA did an unannounced outdoor inspection. In the report, they said that the garden was very nice and made no further comment on it. A few months later, after the annual meeting, an email was sent out to all of the townhomes. It turns out that there was a ban on ""gardens,"" but also that I was far from the only one doing it. The board really liked seeing what everyone was doing and said it was a great thing to see because it shows happy neighbors who are engaged in caring for their community. They were lifting the garden ban and just have some rules banning certain known invasives. Raised beds and containers did not count as ""permanent modifications to the grounds,"" so lifting the ban on them is still consistent with the rules of the property documents (deeds & easements).

In addition to the obvious, this also made my back very happy because my contingency plan was to relocate all 600lbs of that to the basement and keep it going under lights, and now I did not have to do that. 

Anyway, love the content as always. Sorry for sounding like this is a paid comment (it isn't!), but I also I should mention that everything but the soil was sourced from Epic & Botanical. A+ would do again!",KoGlNGk75fQ

Just had a dream when we moved here a year ago, but we've added water all over the yard and some tree work to clear an area for a garden and it feels so much more tangible. This year we plan to put in fruit trees and berry bushes, but I am really hoping for a new raised garden bed for the summer after next. It's all felt so daunting, but seeing what you have done in in only a few years gives me hope that we might have a garden again.",KoGlNGk75fQ

@YuriDoesEverything,1,"Working on my somewhat urban homestead. don’t have much space, way less than you do Kev. But I found out a few months back that most of the soil in my front yard is super fertile land. So I started ripping up the grass last year, who needs a grassy yard anyways? It’s a tough job, and I honestly don’t have much time since my wife and I have a baby on the way and I have to get the house ready for children. My veggies are ready for the ground but it’s been nothing but rain rain and more rain weekend after weekend. Today I’m going to attempt to get a bit done before it rains even more.",KoGlNGk75fQ
