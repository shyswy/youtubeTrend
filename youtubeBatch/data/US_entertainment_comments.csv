@evnii-iq3du,16,"Here’s how to survive a atom bomb/ thermo Nuclear( btw ) this isn’t AI generated this took me like 8 days to fully plan this out. here’s how to survive one: Building a bunker to survive a hydrogen bomb (thermonuclear weapon) involves selecting materials that can withstand extreme pressure, heat, and radiation. While no bunker can offer 100% survival against a direct hit, certain materials and construction methods can offer significant protection. Here’s a list of materials typically used in such high-level protection bunkers:

1. Concrete (Reinforced)
	•	High-density concrete is essential to block both blast waves and radiation.
	•	Concrete is typically reinforced with steel rebar to increase its tensile strength and ability to withstand shockwaves.
	•	Thickness: Concrete walls are often several feet thick (at least 3–6 feet), depending on the design.

2. Steel
	•	Steel plates are used for additional reinforcement, particularly for doors and internal structural supports.
	•	High-strength steel alloys (e.g., tungsten steel or titanium alloys) might be used for critical areas like doors or vaults, providing a buffer against heat and pressure.

3. Lead
	•	Lead shielding is used to block radiation, particularly gamma rays.
	•	Lead is dense, making it highly effective at absorbing radiation. In some designs, it is incorporated into the walls or used as a lining.

4. Titanium
	•	Titanium alloys are used in specific high-stress areas due to their excellent strength-to-weight ratio and resistance to heat and corrosion.
	•	Titanium can be used in bunker doors to prevent warping or failure under extreme conditions.

5. Reinforced Glass
	•	Specialized radiation-proof glass may be used for viewing ports or small windows, though these would be limited in number due to the potential for breakage.
	•	The glass needs to be multi-layered and may include a combination of tungsten and silicon carbide to ensure both impact and radiation resistance.

6. Aluminum
	•	Aluminum alloys are sometimes used in parts of the structure, particularly in areas where weight reduction is necessary but where some level of protection is still required.
	•	Aluminum also acts as a good reflector for certain types of radiation.

7. Blast Doors
	•	Steel alloy blast doors are designed to withstand significant pressure and radiation.
	•	They are often multi-layered, incorporating materials like steel, lead, and sometimes tungsten to ensure they can handle the combined effects of blast and radiation.

8. Air Filtration Systems
	•	HEPA filters and carbon filters are used to remove radioactive particles from the air supply. These are crucial for maintaining breathable air UV after a nuclear event.
	•	Activated charcoal is used to filter out radioactive gases and toxins from the air supply.

9. Earth
	•	Bunkers are often buried several feet underground, using soil and rock as an additional radiation and blast shield. Earth itself is highly effective at absorbing radiation and dissipating shockwaves.

10. Underground Tunnels
	•	Tunnels and internal compartments help dissipate pressure and provide escape routes in case one part of the bunker is compromised.

11. Plumbing and Electrical Systems
	•	Non-conductive materials like PVC for plumbing and copper wire for electrical systems are used to ensure safety. However, all these systems are typically designed to be isolated and shielded from external radiation.

Design Considerations:
	•	Multiple layers: Bunkers are often designed with multiple layers of protection—such as reinforced concrete walls, lead, and steel—each serving a different function in blocking different types of threats (blast, radiation, heat).
	•	Ventilation: A critical system to ensure air circulation without letting radiation in, often with sealed air filters.
	•	Escape routes: These can be constructed from concrete and steel to ensure safe exit in case of structural failure in one part of the bunker. Guys give me stuff to add please.",fAtVPSmMXII

@RKPMLLC,0,"That's a bunch of bullshit. Being able to swim has nothing to do with being black or white. I was in NAVSPECWAR for seven years!! (ST4 & Advanced Training Command Det Little Creek - Fort Story) I swam before the Navy, during my time in the Navy and still do; I grew up with a lot of black kids who swam.  I've met A LOT of WHITE MEN and WOMEN who can't swim. This entire line of thinking about black people and swimming comes from the fact that black people weren't ALLOWED TO SWIM in WHITE SWIMMING POOLS for DECADES! So the notion of us not being able to swim grew and grew. The reason you don't see a lot of black men in SPECIAL FORCES has more to do with EXPOSURE to the opportunity or simply having the desire to do so.  We weren't allowed to be more than cooks in the military for a long time.  When Special Forces units were developed - do you think those WHITE MEN wanted BLACK MEN among those small ranks? No. Why? Racism - it's just that simple. It took a very long time for black men to even WANT TO be a part of SPECIAL FORCES and even then; there were huge obstacles to overcome because of the history of there being predominantly white men in those ranks.  When it comes to ANYTHING ATHLETIC - and I do mean ANYTHING (especially dropping dyck into your wife); black men are far more superior. When it comes to BRAIN POWER - we are just as, if not more capable than anyone else on earth.  I've served with all types of people and trust me.....dumb comes in all colors - physical ability or inability - comes in all colors. When the opportunity presents itself and we have to prove what we are made of; we can do the job. That sergeant - that was his issue. Not all black men.",R-kz3deX1uU
@joeguy1092,0,"Why do you think that is?. Black people can excel and all other sports, except swimming?. Pools are a luxury, most blk grow up in urban areas where there is a lack of pools or even if they grow up in places like Chicago where there is a lake no one really goes swimming.",R-kz3deX1uU

@H45556,1,"My guess, the “peace out” is how they eventually catch the guy. Like they hear a suspect say it or see him sign something online with it.

He’ll say “peace out” right when the cops are gonna give up and they’ll detain him. Something like that",s2Ve3bHoLzc

@AlexKirchhofer,1,Father? Whats a father?,I7adFhI887Q
@LowkBandKidFade,0,"My suicidal ideation started when I was young. About eight years old, to be exact. My uncle had recently passed away from a car wreck with a drunk driver (who was the one that ran into him. The drunk man survived), and that broke my father. It’d been a year prior to my mental health struggles, that my uncle died. My immediate family moved closer to my father’s side of the family, which was extremely stressful for me and my sisters. When I was ten, my suicidal ideation started, like I said before, and my parents got me a therapist quickly. He helped me see through a broader picture, but he also didn’t believe that I was genuinely suicidal even after I’d attempted twice already. He spoke to my parents privately one day and told them something along the lines of:
“The next time she says she’s gonna kill herself, tell her to do it. She doesn’t have the guts. She’s ten, so she’s just looking for attention.”
My parents made me stop seeing him after that without telling me why. To be frank, I didn’t want to know why. 
Over the following four years, I’d been admitted to psychological facilities so many times that I have given up counting. Id attempted twice more times that I was admitted, but I stopped myself, which I’m proud of to this day. 
I’ve been clean of suicide attempts and ideation since September 25th, 2024, and I’ve been clean of self harm since February 20th, 2025. 
I’m so much happier now. I’m so proud of myself because I have survived living with myself repeatedly.
