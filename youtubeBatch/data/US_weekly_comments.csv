@MortedArt,9,"After listen and watch it for many hourss, i finally understand. 
There's two gura in the MV, the one that looks like gura (the white one at early clips) and the alter gura who step on the flowers (the red one). Both is representing gura, but..
The white one : the one we usually saw on stream, the happy one, the one who draw, play games and sing for us ( 0:23 0:36  0:45 ) and
The red one : the other sides of her, that she never show to us. Representing her anger and depression ( 0:31 0:44  0:46  ). 

The pre chorus and chorus is representing different things, it actually more towards her and 'The Ones', ""They say the memory of me is fading, i've heard it all before"" ""Don't tell me everyone around is waiting"" Is represent she is told to keep showing up consistently or everyone will start to forget her, and ""they all say, tear it down burn it down"" Is when 'The Ones' finally asked her to quit through the door, which she replied ""and they all pay, when i tear it down burn it down"". And finally ""When the world falls through and all is ashes again"" Mean when everything is done and finally over. 

The stories continue, her alter (the red one) walks towards the door followed  by gura (the white one). ""voices rise in my head, the hands that pull at my thread"" Represent all the voices and 'The Ones' that try to control her ( 1:40 ), yet her alter ignore it and still trying to quit and keep walking towards the door, destroying anything on her path ( 1:28 2:13 ). 
When her alter finally reach the door and about to open it, gura run and try to prevent her ( 2:34 ) but her alter is too strong that she's thrown away instead and drown into the sea. After drowning deep inside and thought everything is over, The Myth finally showing up one by one ( 3:39  ), holding her, carry her, pull her up, and give her courage to keep fighting and finally gura silhouette and lyrics ""ill listen carefully"" ( 3:51 ) which represents her fans who always support her and she always listen to, give her the ability and strength to fight back. 
With all that help, gura is finally able to fight her alter and winning, but in the end, they understand each others ( 4:25 )and the alter gura vanished , trusting and leaving all decision to gura. After standing for a while,Gura Finally reach to the door, open it, and ""while we all pretend if this is the end, she'll do it again""

Thank you Casey and gura for a beautiful song, and not to forget mazu for the beautiful animation that tell so much story despite the length of the videos. 

Good luck Gura on your next Journeys, Thanks for all the memories you shared. You will always be our little sharküíô",twUFbqyul_M

@madi-olivia07,0,When I found out I was pregnant it was a secret between me and my then 14 year old step daughter who knew I was testing. Right after it turned positive I composed myself enough to walk out and all I had to do was look at her and she knew. Telling her father was nerve racking because we had just decided to wait then SURPRISE! üòÇ,IqEQtrHaeJE

@proconsumersafety,3,"Nice set-up. I would consider putting a covered deck wrap around from the double doors to the sliding doors. This will help so you can work out, then cool down or take a break outside on the deck, and/or open doors during the rain and still have rain protection. Its awesome working out when it is raining and having the deck and cover will allow it more easily, but also a place to cool down. Just a thought. Enjoy. Cheers!",t9PN6zBYCf0
